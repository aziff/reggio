\frametitle{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item This handout summarizes the process and findings of the evaluation of the Reggio Approach
\item Empirical results do not emphatically support that the Reggio Approach has strong effects
\begin{itemize}
	\item Positive results are found in the adult cohorts when compared to other adults who did not attend preschool
	\item The Reggio Approach improves some non-cognitive and mental health outcomes of children and adolescents
\end{itemize}
\item We collected paper records indicating that alternative preschools were available and regulated leading to quality alternatives
\item We designed and implemented a survey to help understand the trajectory of the Reggio Approach's administrative and pedagogical components as well as that of the alternative preschools
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Historical context
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Unpublished historical evidence and empirical results indicate that alternatives were available that had positive effects on children
		\item Paper records indicate that take-up of these programs was very high in Reggio Emilia and Padova
		\item Results from our survey indicate that even though the specific combination of components is unique to the Reggio Approach, several components were seen in other programs over time
		\item This historical analysis allowed us to correct some incorrect categorizations of school type in the data
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Although this did not drastically alter the results, it improved their accuracy and interpretability
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Data limitations
	\begin{itemize}
		\item More family characteristics, especially for the adult cohorts, would help better model the effect of the Reggio Approach by accounting for family disadvantage more fully
		\item Some issues in data collection limit some of the key outcomes such as IQ, school grades, and income
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Sample}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Five age cohorts chosen to capture short-, medium-, and long-term effects and different levels of exposure to the Reggio Approach
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Children (b. 2006)
		\item Adolescents (b. 1994)
		\item Adults in their 30s (b. 1980-1981)
		\item Adults in their 40s (b. 1969-1970)
		\item Adults in their 50s (b. 1954-1959)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Individuals sampled if they were living in the same city as they did when they were of preschool age
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Reggio Emilia
			\item Parma
			\item Padova

\frametitle{Sample}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The sample was selected to be representative of potential users of infant-toddler centers and preschools
	\item Available schools include municipal, religious, and state schools
	\item Some individuals in the sample also stayed at home or attended other informal care

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Sample}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It was not feasible to include those who migrate from the studied cities because the public registries are on the municipal level
	\item If the Reggio Approach affects migration, this would lead to a biased sample
	\item The proportion of Italian citizens still living in the city in which they were born is similar across Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova

\frametitle{Reggio Approach}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Reggio Approach is a form of municipal early childhood education designed by Loris Malaguzzi, an educator influenced by the educational practices and psychological theories of Dewey, Piaget, Erikson, Vygotsky, Bronfenbrenner, Kagan, and Gardner
	\item Malaguzzi, along with Bruno Ciari in Bologna, was one of several left-wing educators within the region of Emilia Romagna who were influenced by these progressive models of education \citep{Cagliari-etal-eds_2016_BOOK_Loris-Malaguzzi}
	\item Some important characteristics of the Reggio Approach
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Educative coordinator (pedagogista)
		\item Arts specialist (atelierista)
		\item Project-based learning led by children's interest 
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Survey of Programs}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In order to understand the alternative programs, we wrote a survey to help structure interviews with administrators and educators in several of the systems in the three cities
	\item We graph the number of characteristics that the surveyed non-Reggio Approach programs had in common with the Reggio Approach at different points of time
	\item We consider 14 administrative components and 16 pedagogical components (not all the pedagogical components are present in the Reggio Approach)
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Summary of Responses}
\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
	\item Hours of center-based care is one commonality largely shared by the surveyed programs
	\item Teachers have dedicated work hours for professional development and documentation
	\item Municipal schools in the three cities shared priorities of enrolling disadvantaged children
	\item It was not until the 1980s that at least one other system had a full-time educative coordinator
	\item Some pedagogical components not in the Reggio Approach: (i) no religious education; (ii) no preset curriculum; and (iii) little influence of Montessori relative to the influence of Malaguzzi
	\item The presence of an arts specialist is more distinctive. Outside of the Reggio Approach, this has only been seen in Padova's municipal school since the 1980s. Although, visual arts were used in a preschool setting in all the other programs by the 1980s.

\frametitle{Methodology}
\begin{itemize}
	\item OLS with varying control sets 
	\item Difference-in-difference (DiD) across cities 
	\item AIPW to account for selection into the Reggio Approach beyond OLS and DiD

\frametitle{Summary of Results}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Children
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Improved non-cognitive outcome (SDQ)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Adolescents
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Improved non-cognitive and mental health outcomes, less likely to drop out of school, more likely to dislike school, more likely to be unhealthy (obese and less exercise)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Adults
		\begin{itemize}
		\item The most positive and significant results are seen when compared with adults who attended no preschool
		\item More likely to be employed (40s) and work more hours (30s and 40s)
		\item Less depressed and more internal locus of control (40s)
		\item More likely to vote (40s)
