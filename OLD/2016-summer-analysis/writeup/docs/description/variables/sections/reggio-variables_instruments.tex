%\subsection{Distance as Instrumental Variable}
%Fourteen instrumental variables have been contructed that measure the distance from each individual's house to the two nearest municipal, state, religious, and private schools in both \textit{asilo} and \textit{materna} categories. The data contains (i) a variable that records respondent's self-reported home address, and (ii) information including name, address, and years of operation of 372 \textit{asilo} and \textit{materna} school. ArcGIS is used to generate exact coordinates for each house and school address from this data. These coordinates are used to calculate geodetic distances from each individual's house to every school in the data. The two smallest distances for each school type is stored and used as instrumental variables.
