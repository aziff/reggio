\caption{In this table, \textbf{T} denotes the treatment group and \textbf{C} denotes the control group. The treatment group is the municipal infant-toddler care and preschool care given in Reggio. This is what is commonly referred to as the ``Reggio" intervention. The municipal school was only widely available for Cohorts I-IV (approximately ages 6 to mid-40s at the time of interview). In addition to the municipal school there is also other types of infant-toddler care and preschools (state, religious, private, none). An exception is that there is no state infant-toddler care.}
