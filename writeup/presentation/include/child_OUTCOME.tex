The final comparison group (column 4) are individuals living in Reggio Emilia, Parma, or Padova who did not attend RA.
 Standard errors of means in brackets. Test for difference in means between each column and the first column (Reggio Municipal, the treatment group) was performed; *** significant difference at 1\%, ** significant difference at 5\%, * significant difference at 10\%.
