\section{Overview}

This document presents difference-in-difference results. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the impact of the Reggio Approach on outcomes over a population of individuals. The difference-in-difference estimators can account for potential issues with the simple difference estimators. The treatment effect with the simple difference estimators can be confounded due to the existence of trends. The potential problems for each type of simple differences in the Reggio analysis are the following: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Fixing city and cohort:} Consider the case where we fix city and cohort and compare people who went to municipal schools and people who went to religious schools. If the baseline characteristics of people who select into municipal schools and of people who select into religious schools differ, there might exist permanent average differences in outcomes between two groups. Hence, the simple difference estimator includes both the treatment effect of the Reggio Approach and the permanent average differences between groups. 
\item \textbf{Fixing school type and cohort:} Consider the case where we only look at people who went to municipal school in a certain cohort and compare those people across different cities. In this case, the simple difference does not show the impact of the treatment \textit{per se} if there exists the permanent average differences in outcomes between cities. 
\item \textbf{Fixing city and school type:} Consider the case where we fix city to Reggio, fix school type to municipal, and compare people across different age cohorts. 
\end{enumerate}

\underline{Note:} This table shows difference in difference across school types and cohorts with the sample restricted to individuals of adult cohorts living in Reggio. For convenience, we denote "Age 30 None" as individuals in the age-30 cohort who did not attend any materna school. Notations are analogous across cohort and school type. Each column shows the following diff-in-diff estimate. \textbf{(1)} (Age 30 None - Age 30 Muni) - (Age 50 None - Age 50 Muni), \textbf{(2)} (Age 30 State - Age 30 Muni) - (Age 50 State - Age 50 Muni), \textbf{(3)} (Age 30 Reli - Age 30 Muni) - (Age 50 Reli - Age 50 Muni), \textbf{(4)} (Age 40 None - Age 40 Muni) - (Age 50 None - Age 50 Muni),  \textbf{(5)} (Age 40 State - Age 40 Muni) - (Age 50 State - Age 50 Muni), \textbf{(6)} (Age 40 Reli - Age 40 Muni) - (Age 50 Reli - Age 50 Muni).
