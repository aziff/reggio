\section{Cognitive Variables}
\label{sec:cog}

IQ is measured for all individuals in the sample as well as for the caregivers of the children, migrants, and adolescents. The test used to measure IQ is Raven's Progressive Matrices (Raven's)
%\footnote{\citet{Raven_Raven_etal_1988_BOOKManualRavensprogressive}.}.
Raven's is a non-verbal test that is correlated with other measures of fluid intelligence. The 12-Item and 18-Item versions are shortened from the original version, which helps reduce the duration of the test.

 Table \ref{tab:test-type} explains which individuals in which cohort received the 12- or 18-Item version of Raven's Progress Matrices (Raven's).
