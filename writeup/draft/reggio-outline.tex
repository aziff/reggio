\section{Proposed}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Brief overview of the section
\begin{itemize}
	\item There are similarities and differences seen between the Reggio Approach and alternatives both in Reggio Emilia and those in Parma and Padova
	\item We build on the foundation of the published literature by administering a survey to school officials and collating historical records
	\item Brief description of survey contents and respondents (table)
	\item We discuss aspects of the municipal schools, including the Reggio Approach, state schools, and religious schools.
\end{itemize}
\item Municipal Schools
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Reggio Approach: brief history, pedagogical approach, administrative services
	\item Based on the core aspects listed above, we constructed a survey to compare with other school types in Reggio Emilia and the other cities
	\item Compare between Reggio Approach and other municipal programs
	\end{itemize}
\item State Schools
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Description of state schools in the three cities drawing from survey results as needed
	\item All this will \textit{compare} to the Reggio Approach
	\end{itemize}
\item Religious Schools
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Description of religious schools in the three cities drawing from survey results as needed
	\item All this will \textit{compare} to the Reggio Approach
