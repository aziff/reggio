%Table \ref{ols-N-reg} shows no consistently significant trends between the age-30 cohort and age-40 cohort. For the age-30 cohort, there are significantly decreasing effects on the optimistic look in life. Moreover, there are significantly increasing effects on whether the respondent is likely to do the same to someone who puts him/her in a difficult situation and to someone who insults him/her.

%For the age-40 cohort, results show the significantly decreasing effects on depression for the age-30 cohort. There are also significantly positive effects on satisfaction with income and with work for the age-40 cohort. However, there are significantly positive effects on whether the respondent thinks work is source of stress.
