The Reggio Approach includes two stages of early childhood interventions: (i) Infant Toddler Centers between ages 0-3 and (ii) Preschool between ages 3-6. Table~\ref{tab:cases-treat} shows the four possible combinations of interventions that a child could potentially receive, where 0 indicates not attending and 1 indicates attending. It is important to note that the 1 case only includes those who attended Municipal institutions, and 0 includes those who who didn't attend any childcare as well as those who attended non-Municipal childcare.

\footnotesize{Note:} We only consider municipal ITCs (infant-toddler-centers, ages 0-3) and preschools (ages 3-6). (0,0): did not attend any municipal school for both ages 0-3 and 3-6; (1,0): attended a municipal school for ages 0-3 but did \textit{not} attend for ages 3-6; (0,1): did \textit{not} attend a municipal school for ages 0-3 but did attend for ages 3-6; (1,1): attended a municipal school for both ages 0-3 and 3-6.

The distribution of individuals who experienced each combination of the interventions in our data is reported in Table \ref{tab:num-group} for different cohort-city combinations. It is immediately apparent that (1,0) - the case where a child attends Municipal ITC but not the Municipal Preschool - is virtually non-existent over time and across cities.  The (0,0) case, where a child receives neither intervention, demonstrates a sharp decline in frequency between the adult and younger cohorts, and this drop is consistent across cities. We focus the remainder of this paper on the evaluation of the preschool intervention at ages 3-6. We present results and our strategy for evaluating the ITC intervention in appendix \ref{sec:ITC}.

%\subsection{Estimating Effects of Infant-Toddler Centers}
%There are two main methods to test the effect of attending infant-toddler centers. The first is to compare people who did not attend infant-toddler care or preschool with people who only attended municipal infant-toddler care. Using the notation in Table~\ref{tab:cases-treat}, this comparison is between (0,0) and (1,0). The second method is to compare people who only attended municipal preschool with people who attended both municipal infant-toddler centers and preschools. That is, to compare (0,1) and (1,1). The hypotheses are formally written as
%\begin{eqnarray}
%H_1: &  Y_{0,0} = Y_{1,0} \\ 
%H_2: &  Y_{0,1} = Y_{1,1} 
%\end{eqnarray}
%\noindent where $Y_{i,j}$ is the outcome of the individuals who attended $i \in \{0,1\}$ infant-toddler care and $j \in \{0,1\}$ preschool.
%
%A possible estimation strategy is to limit the sample to a specific city and a specific cohort constrained to the comparison groups needed according to the hypotheses above. To test $H_1$, we estimate the following regression equation:
%\begin{eqnarray}
%Y_{i}^{c,h} & = & \alpha + \beta_{0}R_i^{ITC} + \mathbf{X}_i\gamma + \varepsilon_{i}^{c,h}, \\ \nonumber
%& \forall & i \in \text{ \{People in city $c$ and cohort $h$ and in group (0,0) or (1,0)\}}
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $R_i^{ITC}$ is the indicator for attending municipal infant-toddler center and $\mathbf{X_i}$ is the vector of baseline variables for individual $i$. Likewise, to test $H_2$:
%\begin{eqnarray}
%Y_{i}^{c,h} & = & \alpha + \beta_{0}R_i^{ITC} + \mathbf{X}_i\gamma + \varepsilon_{i}^{c,h}, \\ \nonumber
%& \forall & i \in \text{ \{People in city $c$ and cohort $h$ and in group (0,1) or (1,1)\}.}
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%One caveat of this analysis is that it uses a limited sample size. In our data, these hypotheses cannot be tested under this strategy for many groups. Table~\ref{tab:num-group} shows the number of individuals available for each group necessary for analysis using this strategy. It is impossible to test $H_1$ in our data, because there are almost no people who attended municipal infant-toddler care without attending preschool (the group (1,0)). While it is possible to test $H_2$ for several groups, the number of observations for the group (1,1) is small for the adult cohorts. 
%
%In Table \ref{tab:num-group}, the groups subject to our estimation are highlighted. Based on the available number of individuals in each cell and the history of the foundation date of municipal infant-toddler care for each city, we decide to test $H_2$ for the highlighted groups.

\subsection{Estimating Effects of Preschools}
We adopt a three-pronged approaach to evaluate the effects of the Reggio Approach Preschool intervention. Firstly, in subsection \ref{subsubsection:OLS}, we describe an OLS model that allows us to compare the outcomes of those who attended Municipal Preschool in Reggio to those from Reggio who did not attend Municipal Preschool. In subsection \ref{subsubsection:DID}, we present a Difference-in-Differences approach that allows us to make cross-city comparisons of outcomes for those who attended  Municipal preschool in each city, while controlling for permanent differences between cities. Lastly, subsection \ref{subsection:selection} presents a multinomial logit model to test for the presence of selection into treatment, and an AIPW model that adjusts estimated treatment effects to account for potential selection into treatment.

\subsubsection{Baseline OLS} \label{subsubsection:OLS}
We perform several within-Reggio comparisons using a baseline OLS model. We compare individuals from Reggio Emilia who attended a Reggio Approach preschool to those in Reggio Emilia who attended (i) any type of preschool, (ii) no preschool, (iii) state preschool, and (iv) religious preschool. We only present estimates of the first comparison  in the main paper. Estimates from the other comparisons are reported in Appendix~\ref{app:comparison-reli-stat}. We exclude the cohort of adults in their 50s because the Reggio Approach was not available at that time.

The basic OLS takes the form, 

\begin{equation}
	Y_i = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 R_i^{P} + \bm{X}_i\gamma + \varepsilon_i
	\label{eq:ra-v-none}
\end{equation}

where $i$ indexes individuals in Reggio Emilia, $R_i^{P}$ is an indicator for whether individual $i$ attended municipal preschool in Reggio, $\bm{X}_i$ is a vector of baseline control variables\footnote{These variables are: gender, whether the individual took the computer-assisted (CAPI), number of siblings, an indicator if the mother's maximum education was middle school, an indicator if the father's maximum education is university, and two indicators for the number of siblings (one indicating having two or more siblings, the other indicating having three or more siblings).} selected based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and $\varepsilon_i$ is a random disturbance.

\subsubsection{Difference-in-Difference}  \label{subsubsection:DID}
Next, we estimate a Difference-in-Differences model that allows for cross-city comparisons of Municipal preschools while controlling for permanent differences in characteristics between cities. We restrict the analysis to individuals in the age-30 and age-40 cohorts and estimate the model seperately for each cohort. In the main paper, we present comparisons between municipal schools and all other types of preschools pooled together. We present comparisons to specific school types in Appendices~\ref{app:comparison-reli-stat}.

To illustrate, we present the comparison between between Reggio and Parma for those who either attended Municipal preschool or no preschool at all. We can write the estimation equation for this case as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}  \label{eq:specific2}
Y_i & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Reggio_i + \beta_2 R_i^P + \beta_3 Reggio_i * R_i^P + \bm{X}_i\delta + \epsilon_i 
\end{eqnarray}
where  Eq.\ref{eq:specific2} is estimated seperately for the age 30 and 40 cohorts, and $Reggio_i$ is the indicator for individual $i$ living in Reggio Emilia. $\beta_3$ is interpreted as the difference that remains between Municipal schools in Reggio and Parma after adjusting for permanent differences between the two cities. In other words, $\beta_3$ amounts to (Reggio Municipal - Parma Municipal) - (Reggio None - Parma None), where the first difference captures the unadjusted(for permanent city differences) difference between Municipal preschools in each city, and the second difference captures the permanent differences between the two cities. Analogous interpretations are applied to difference-in-difference comparisons between Reggio Emilia and Padova.

\subsection{Accounting for Selection into Treatment} \label{subsection:selection}

\subsubsection{Differences in Selection across Cities: Multinomial Logit}
We estimate multinomial logit models for each city using preschool choice as the dependent variable, and a vector of baseline characteristics as independent variables. We then compare the estimated marginal effects for each baseline characteristic to investigate whether a common set of baseline characteristics determines selection into municipal preschools across the three cities. This analysis highlights characteristics that determine selection into the municipal schools relative to preschool alternatives available within the same city. Substantial differences in selection across cities would suggest that selection into municipal schools differ by city. This could be a result of different parental perceptions of quality, the available slots, or other factors determining demand for municipal schools relative to alternative options. 

To begin, we define the choices available to parents in each city as follows:
\begin{equation}
S_i = \quad
\begin{cases}
0 \quad \text{if \quad (\textit{i} did not attend any preschool)} \\
1 \quad  \text{if \quad (\textit{i} attended an alternative preschool)} \\
2 \quad \text{if \quad (\textit{i} attended a municipal preschool)}  \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent We then estimate the following multinomial logit specification separately for each city:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:log-odds-ratio}
\nu_r = \text{log} \left(\frac{Pr(S_i=r)}{Pr(S_i=2)}\right) = \beta_0^r + \bm{\beta^r X}_i + \epsilon_i^r \quad \forall \quad r \in 0,1
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bm{X}_i$ is a vector of baseline characteristics including child's gender, number of child's siblings, religiosity of caregiver, mothers education level, and indicators for whether parents were born in province.

The predicted log-odds ratio for each alternative option, $\hat{\nu}_r$, from (\ref{eq:log-odds-ratio}) can be used to construct the estimated probability of attending each school type $r$ as follows:

\begin{equation}
\pi_{i,r} = \frac{\text{exp}(\hat{\nu}_{r,i})}{\sum\limits_{j=0}^{2} \text{exp}(\hat{\nu}_{j,i})} \quad \forall  r \in 0,1,2
\end{equation}

Finally, we estimate the impact of each characteristic $x_c$ of $\bm{X}$ on the propensity to attend a school type $r$, $\pi_{r}$, by calculating the partial derivative $\partial \pi_{r}/\partial x_c$. 
%These results are reported in Appendix~\ref{appendix:mlogit}.

\subsubsection{Augmented IPW}

Although the baseline OLS and difference-in-difference models attempt to account for the selection into the Reggio Approach, regression estimator for ATE may be poorly estimated when the observed values of baseline variables are not similar for the treatment and control groups. We estimate an Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighted (AIPW) estimator that builds on the multinomial logit presented above in order to account for the caveats with the regression estimator.   
%\citep{Glynn_2010}. 

To begin, consider the following two treatment statuses,

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cases-d}
D_i = \quad
\begin{cases}
1 \quad if \quad &  R_i = 0 \text{\quad 		($i$ from Reggio Emilia but did not attend Reggio Approach)} \\
0 \quad if \quad &  R_i \neq 0 \text{\quad 	($i$ from Reggio Emilia and attended the Reggio Approach).} \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
~\\
Let $Y_{1,i}$ and $Y_{0,i}$ represent counterfactual outcomes for individual, $i$, where treatment status is fixed to $D_i=1$ and $D_i=0$ respectively. Under this framework, the realized outcome $Y_i$ is summarized by,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:roy}
Y_i = (1-D_i)Y_{0,i} + D_iY_{1,i}.
\end{equation}

Next, assume that individuals select into treatment status $D_i$ based on a a set of observed baseline characteristics $\boldsymbol{X}_i$. Under the assumption of strongly ignorable selection into treatment given $\boldsymbol{X}_i$, and the existence of an estimated propensity score $\hat{\pi({\boldsymbol{X}_i})} = Pr(D_i=1|\boldsymbol{X}_i)$ such that $0<\hat{\pi({\boldsymbol{X}_i})}<1$, we can use standard Inverse Propensity of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) to estimate the average treatment effect $E[Y(1)-Y(0)]$,

\begin{equation}\label{eq:IPW}
\widehat{E[Y(1)-Y(0)]_{IPW}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left \{\frac{D_i Y_i}{\hat{\pi(\boldsymbol{X}_i)}} - \frac{(1-D_i)Y_i}{1-\hat{\pi(\boldsymbol{X}_i)}}\right \}
\end{equation}

\noindent Where $\hat{\pi({\boldsymbol{X}_i})} = Pr(D_i=1|\boldsymbol{X}_i)$ is predicted for each individual $i$ using the estimated coefficients obtained from a probit model.

In calculating $\widehat{E[Y(1)]}$, the IPTW estimator assigns a higher weight to individuals with characteristics $\boldsymbol{X}_i$ if these individuals are less likely to have been in treatment group $D = 1$. Analogously, in calculating $\widehat{E[Y(0)]}$,  the IPTW estimator assigns a higher weight to individuals with characteristics $\boldsymbol{X}_i$ if these individuals are less likely to have been in treatment group $D = 0$. In this sense, the estimator adjusts for selection on observables by balancing the estimation of expected outcomes on $\boldsymbol{X}$.

An issue with the simple IPTW estimator is that the estimates become unstable as the estimated propensities, $\hat{\pi(\boldsymbol{X}_i)}$, tend to 0 or 1. We use the following Augmented IPW (AIPW) estimator to correct for this issue. 
\begin{align}\label{eq:AIPW}
E[\widehat{Y(1)-Y(0)]}_{AIPW} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \bigg \{ \bigg[ & \overbrace{\frac{D_i Y_i}{\hat{\pi(\boldsymbol{X}_i)}} - \frac{(1-D_i)Y_i}{1-\hat{\pi(\boldsymbol{X}_i)}}}^{IPTW} \bigg]- \frac{D_i - \hat{\pi}(\boldsymbol{X}_i)}{\hat{\pi}(\boldsymbol{X}_i) (1-\hat{\pi}(\boldsymbol{X}_i))} \nonumber \\[10pt]
& \bigg[ (1-\hat{\pi}(\boldsymbol{X}_i)) E[\hat{Y_i}|D_i=1,\boldsymbol{X}_i] + \hat{\pi}(\boldsymbol{X}_i) E[\hat{Y_i}|D_i=0,\boldsymbol{X}_i] \bigg] \bigg \}
\end{align}

The AIPW estimator in Equation (\ref{eq:AIPW}) addresses the problem of instability associated with the IPTW estimator near $\hat{\pi(\boldsymbol{X}_i)} = 0$ or $1$, by adjusting the weighted estimator with a weighted average of $\hat{Y_i}$ obtained from an OLS regression. For $D_i = 0$, as the IPTW estimate becomes large and negative near $\hat{\pi(\boldsymbol{X}_i)} = 1$, the adjustment term becomes large and positive, thereby, stabilizing the estimator at these values. Analogously, for $D = 1$, as the IPTW estimate becomes large and positive near $\hat{\pi(\boldsymbol{X}_i)} = 0$, the adjustment term becomes large and negative. 

\citet{Tsiatis_2006} and \citet{Glynn_2010} show that the AIPW estimator is an unbiased estimator of the Average Treatment Effect if the propensity score is known. Further, they show that the estimator is consistent if either the propensity score model or the outcome prediction model in the adjustment term is correctly specified. Due to this last property, they refer to the AIPW as a doubly robust estimator.

%\subsubsection{AIPW Using Multinomial Control Selection Model}
%\label{sec:aipw-mlogit}
%An issue with the AIPW estimator in Equation (\ref{eq:AIPW}) is that the control group, $D_i=0$, includes all individuals who did not attend Reggio Municipal schools. As a result, we are unable to account for potential heterogeneity in treatment effects with respect to control group individuals who attended different types of preschools. In the rest of this subsection, we present an extension of the two-outcome AIPW that takes into account the non-binary nature of treatment statuses in our sample. 
%
%To account for this heterogeneity, we can start by defining a new variable for treatment status,
%
%\begin{equation}
%T_i = \quad
%\begin{cases}
%0 \quad \text{if \quad (\textit{i} from Reggio Emilia and attended no preschool)} \\
%1 \quad  \text{if \quad (\textit{i} from Reggio Emilia and attended other preschool)} \\
%2 \quad \text{if \quad (\textit{i} from Reggio Emilia and attended Reggio Approach)}  \\
%\end{cases}
%\end{equation}
%~\\ ~\\
%Let $Y_{j,i}$ denote the counterfactual outcome for individual $i$ when treatment status $T_i$ is fixed to $j$ $\forall \,  j \, \in \{0,1,2\}$. Under this framework, individual $i$'s potential outcomes can be represented as,
%\begin{equation}
%Y_i = \sum_{j=0}^{2}(\mathbb{1}_{T_i = j}) Y_{j,i}
%\end{equation}
%\noindent Where $\mathbb{1}_{T_i=j}$ is an indicator that equals one if the treatment status of individual $i$ is set to $j$.
%
%\noindent The average treatment effect with respect to each control group, $j$, can be defined,
%\begin{equation}
%ATE_j = E[Y(2) - Y(j)] \quad \forall j \in \{0,1\}
%\end{equation}
%Thus, the IPW estimator of the treatment effect with respect to each control group, $j$, can be defined as, 
%
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:IPWmulti}
%\widehat{IPW}_j=\widehat{E[Y(2)-Y(j)]}_{IPW} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left \{\frac{(\mathbb{1}_{T_i=2}) Y_i}{\hat{\Pi_2}(\boldsymbol{X}_i)} - \frac{(\mathbb{1}_{T_i=j})Y_i}{\hat{\Pi_j}(\boldsymbol{X}_i)}\right \}
%\end{equation}
%~\\
%\noindent Where $\hat{\Pi_j}(\boldsymbol{X}_i) = Pr(T_i=j|\boldsymbol{X}_i) \quad \forall \, j \in \{0,1,2\}$, is predicted for each individual, $i$, using the estimated coefficients obtained from a multinomial logit model. 
%
%Similarly, we may define the AIPW estimator of the treatment effect with respect to each control group, $j$, as,
%
%\begin{align}\label{eq:AIPWmulti}
%\widehat{AIPW_{j}} = E[\widehat{Y(2)-Y(j)]}_{AIPW} =& \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\bigg \{ \bigg[ \overbrace{ \frac{(\mathbb{1}_{T_i=2}) Y_i}{\hat{\Pi_2}(\boldsymbol{X}_i)} - \frac{(\mathbb{1}_{T_i=j})Y_i}{\hat{\Pi_j}(\boldsymbol{X}_i)}}^{IPTW}  \bigg] - \frac{(\mathbb{1}_{T_i=2}) - \hat{\Pi}_2(\boldsymbol{X}_i)}{\hat{\Pi}_2(\boldsymbol{X}_i) \, \hat{\Pi}_j(\boldsymbol{X}_i)} \nonumber \\[10pt]
%& \bigg[ \hat{\Pi}_j(\boldsymbol{X}_i) \cdot E[\hat{Y_i}|T_i=2,\boldsymbol{X}_i] +\hat{\Pi}_2(\boldsymbol{X}_i) \cdot E[\hat{Y_i}|T_i=j,\boldsymbol{X}_i] \bigg] \bigg \}
%\end{align}
