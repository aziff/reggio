\footnotesize\raggedright{Note: This table shows the estimates of the coefficient for attending Reggio Approach infant-toddler centers from multiple methods. We compare Reggio Approach people with people who attended other infant-toddler centers. Column title indicates the corresponding control set and and model. ``NoneIt'' refers to the OLS estimate with no control variables. ``BICIt'' refers to the OLS estimate with controls selected by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and additional controls for caregiver's religion. ``FullIt'' refers to the OLS estimate with the full set of controls. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. Bold number shows that the estimate is statistically significant at the 10\% level. Number of observations used in estimation is reported in italic.}
