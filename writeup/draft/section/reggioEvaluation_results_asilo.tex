% CHILD COHORT

Tables \ref{ols-M-child-reg-nopres-asilo} to \ref{ols-M-adult40-reg-nopres-asilo} show the estimation results for Reggio Approach infant-toddler centers based on the previous section. 

For children cohort, Reggio Approach infant-toddler centers have significantly positive effect on IQ factor and obesity relative to no infant-toddler centers in Reggio. For adolescents cohort, Reggio Approach infant-toddler centers do not have clear affect relative to no infant-toddler centers. 

For adult 30s cohort, Reggio Approach infant-toddler centers have significantly negative effect on IQ score, IQ factor, high school grade, and locus of control. Moreover, Reggio Approach infant-toddler centers have significantly positive effect on hours worked per week, marriage, and obesity. For adult 40s cohort, Reggio Approach has significantly negative effect on IQ score, high school grades, and marriage. However, Reggio Approach is shown to have positive effects on obesity.

We compare Reggio Approach people with people who attended no infant-toddler center. Column title indicates the corresponding control set and and model.  \textbf{None} = OLS estimate with no control variables. \textbf{BIC} = OLS estimate with controls selected by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and additional controls for male indicator and ITC attendance indicator. \textbf{Full} = OLS estimate with the full set of controls. \textbf{PSM} =  propensity score matching estimation. Bold number shows that the estimate is statistically significant at the 15\% level. Number of observations used in estimation is reported in italic.}
