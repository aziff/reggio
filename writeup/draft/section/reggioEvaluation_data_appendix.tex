\subsection{Description of Data}

Table \ref{table:summaryStat_baseline} presents summary statistics for baseline variables by cohort and city. As mentioned above, certain baseline variables are missing for the adult cohorts due to differences in questionnaires administered to adults and children. The table illustrates differences and similarities in parental, caregiver and family characteristics across cities as well as over time. \textbf{[JJH: What is CAPI?][Team: We have fixed the description]}

\subsection{Characteristics of Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova}
\label{app:characteristics-cities}

Table~\ref{table:data-sources} lists the sources of the myriad of historical records that we investigated. Tables~\ref{table:demo-employ} and~\ref{table:demo-other} describe the cities along demographic characteristics based on those records. Reggio Emilia and Parma, in addition to being geographically close are socially and economically similar.

\subsection{Sample Differences in Municipal and Municipal-Affiliated Preschools}

In this section, we test if there are differences in baseline characteristics between the sample that attends municipal preschools and the sample that attends municipal-affiliated preschools across each city. As Table \ref{tab:sample} in the main paper shows, there are only few people who attended municipal-affiliated preschools for each cell, except for the child cohorts in Parma and Padova. Since there are very few people in the adult cohorts who attended municipal-affiliated school, we decide to test the differences in baseline characteristics only for child and adolescent cohorts.
