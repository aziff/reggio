The Reggio Children Approach to Early Childhood Education (the Reggio Approach) is a birth to age-6 early childhood program developed in Reggio Emilia, Italy by Loris Malaguzzi in the early 1960s. This approach has been a source of inspiration for hundreds of early childhood centers in many countries with varying early childcare contexts.\footnote{The official \href{http://www.reggiochildren.it/network/?lang=en}{Reggio Children International Network} is present in 33 countries worldwide.} Despite its worldwide recognition, the Reggio Approach has never been formally evaluated, and there is little empirical evidence of its effectiveness. 

The evaluation of the Reggio Approach faces several challenges given the non-experimental nature of the program and prevalence of other high-quality childcare programs. The preschool attendance rate of Italian children aged 3-6 years increased from 50\% in the 1960s to 96\% in the 1990s \citep{Hohnerlein_2015_Development-and-Diffusion}. In the late 20th century, Northern Italy witnessed a further rise in local early childhood investments including high-quality universal educational programs and services. These programs were influenced by Malaguzzi as well as other respected early childhood experts \citep{OECD_2001_Italy-Country-Note}. Therefore, children who were not enrolled in the Reggio Approach preschools had the option of attending other established childcare, which makes it difficult to evaluate the effect of the Reggio Approach \textit{per se}. 

This paper presents an evaluation of the Reggio Approach accounting for the challenges mentioned above. We compare the Reggio Approach to other programs and understand the similarities and differences between these programs. We have collected data on individuals who have attended each type of early childhood education, as well as those who were informally cared for outside of a center setting. Our sample includes individuals across five age cohorts: three cohorts of adults, one cohort of adolescents, and one cohort of children in their first year of elementary school. The individuals are not only from Reggio Emilia, but also from Padova and Parma, two cities that are similar to Reggio Emilia along several dimensions but have different preschool systems.  

In addition to describing the programs (Section~\ref{sec:eceexperiences}), data (Section~\ref{sec:data}), methods (Section~\ref{sec:methodology}), and results (Section~\ref{sec:result}), we discuss challenges of collecting quality data as well as the historical context that has made construction of a suitable comparison group difficult. We complement the discussion of our empirical results with uniquely collated historical records and an original survey administered to officials across the different school systems.

%We find the strongest results comparing adults in their 40s who attended the Reggio Approach with those in Reggio Emilia who did not attend any preschool. These results persist when we make comparisons against those who attended municipal programs in other cities, especially Padova. This is consistent with historical information about the lower availability of alternative preschools at this time and the unavailability of the municipal system in Padova before the age-30 cohorts.

%Although evidence from seminal experiments in early childhood education demonstrates the potential for early childhood education to improve life-cycle outcomes, there are many early childhood interventions implemented with little empirical evidence of their effectiveness.\footnote{For an example of an analysis of the Perry Preschool Program, see \citet{Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_QE}. See \citet{Elango_Hojman_etal_2016_Early-Edu} for an overview of the literature evaluating early childhood education.} The Reggio Approach is one such intervention. Since its inception in 1963 in Reggio Emilia, Italy, the Reggio Approach has been implemented in the municipal schools of Reggio Emilia, as well as replicated internationally.\footnote{The official \href{http://www.reggiochildren.it/network/?lang=en}{Reggio Children International Network} is present in 33 countries worldwide.}

%This paper presents an evaluation the Reggio Approach.\footnote{Although the Reggio Approach includes infant-toddler centers (ages 0-3) and preschools (ages 3-6), we focus our evaluation on the preschools. See Appendix~\ref{sec:asilo_results} for an analysis of the infant-toddler centers.} The Reggio Approach is administrated through the municipal government of Reggio Emilia. Other early childhood education options include state preschools and religious infant-toddler centers and preschools.
