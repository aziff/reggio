Evidence from seminal experiments in early childhood interventions, such as the Perry Preschool Program, demonstrates the potential for early childhood education to improve life-cycle outcomes of disadvantaged individuals \citep{Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_QE, Elango_Hojman_etal_2016_Early-Edu}. There are many early childhood interventions that are widely replicated with little empirical evidence of their effectiveness. One such intervention is the Reggio Approach (RA). Starting in 1963 in Reggio Emilia in Northern Italy, the RA is still implemented in the municipal schools of Reggio Emilia, as well as replicated internationally.\footnote{The official \href{http://www.reggiochildren.it/network/?lang=en}{Reggio Children International Network} is present in 33 countries worldwide. Many other preschools around the world are ``inspired'' by the Reggio Approach but they are not officially part of these network.}

This paper presents an evaluation of the Reggio Approach early childhood education system in Reggio Emilia, which includes infant-toddler centers (ages 0-3) and preschools (ages 3-6). The Reggio Approach is administrated through the municipal government of Reggio Emilia. Other early childhood education options include state preschools and private infant-toddler centers and preschools. We have collected data on individuals who have attended all these types of early childhood education as well as those who were informally taken care of outside of a center setting. 

Our sample includes individuals across five age cohorts: three cohorts of adults, one cohort of adolescents, and one cohort of children in their first year of elementary school. The individuals are not only from Reggio Emilia, but also from Padova and Parma, two cities that are similar to Reggio Emilia along several dimensions but have different preschool systems. 

Evaluating the Reggio Approach presents several challenges, given the non-experimental nature of the program. The Reggio Approach preschool system was introduced in 1963, grew over the decades, and now has infrastructure to teach educators about the Reggio Approach. Therefore, he evaluation strategy has to account for potential changes in treatment over time, lack of well defined control group, and potential spillover of the Reggio Approach into other programs attended by individuals in the data.

In Section~\ref{sec:eceexperiences}, we describe the Reggio Approach and the other early childhood education experiences in the three cities focusing on administrative changes that might have led to a diffusion of aspects of the Reggio Approach. We also present an overview of the demographic aspects of Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova that contextualize the differences in approaches to early childhood education. Section~\ref{sec:data} describes the data in more detail and discusses the outcome variables that are available for the different cohorts. Section~\ref{sec:methodology} discusses the methodology we employ to produce the results discussed in Section~\ref{sec:results}. Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.
