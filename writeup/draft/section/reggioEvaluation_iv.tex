It is possible our estimates suffer from self-selection bias as parents' preschool choices for children could depend on unobserved characteristics that also affect the outcomes of interest. We attempt to control for such potential selection by estimating an instrumental variables model using two-stage least squares. We estimate the following system of equations:
\begin{align}
D_i &= \alpha_0 + \bm{Z}_i \bm{\alpha} + \bm{X}_i \bm{\delta} + \nu_i \label{eq:first-stage}\\
Y_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \hat{D_i} + \bm{X}_i \bm{\gamma} + \epsilon_i \label{eq:second-stage}
\end{align}
where %Equation~\eqref{eq:first-stage} corresponds to the first stage, Equation \eqref{eq:second-stage} corresponds to the second stage, 
$\bm{X}_i$ is the vector of BIC-selected baseline controls, $D_i$ is an indicator for attending a Reggio Approach preschool, $\hat{D_i}$ is the predicted value of $D_i$ obtained from the first-stage regression~\eqref{eq:first-stage}, and $\bm{Z}_i$ is a vector of instruments that influence the choice of preschool $D_i$ but are assumed to have no effect on the outcome $Y_i$. The vector of instruments, $\bm{Z}_i$, includes four variables measuring the distance between individuals' residence and the closest municipal, state, religious and private preschools; the squared terms for each of the four distance instruments; and a variable that approximates the score used by the Reggio Approach preschools to rank applicants and allocate available slots based on baseline background characteristics.\footnote{The score is approximated as a function of number of siblings, parents' employment status, parents' migrant status, whether parents were adoptive or custodial, whether both parents are present in household, and distance to grandparents' residence. The score was constructed using weights published by the \citet{Reggio-Emilia_2012_Criteria-admission-2013-14}.} Cost of attendance was explored as as a potential instrument. It is not included in the analysis because preschool fees are determined based on household income and our data suffers from missing income data.

The instrumental variable (IV) analysis is only presented for children and adolescents due to lack of available instruments for adults. Distance, which is constructed based on the residential address reported during time of interview, becomes increasingly unreliable as respondents age because individuals are more likely to leave their childhood homes and establish new residences as they enter adulthood. The score is constructed using guidelines published in 2012. This instrument also becomes increasingly unreliable with age of respondent because the weighting scheme used to allocate available slots to children is likely to have evolved over time as a result of changes in economic, social, demographic and cultural conditions.

Section~\ref{appendix:iv-first} presents results from the estimation of equation~\eqref{eq:first-stage}, the first stage regression. The results are generally insignificant and show that the instruments are weak predictors of enrollment in Reggio Approach preschools. Given the weak first stage, the IV estimation is unlikely to substantially correct for potential bias stemming from selection into Reggio Approach preschools. Estimates of the effect of the Reggio Approach (the second stage regression of equation~\eqref{eq:second-stage}) are presented in Section~\ref{appendix:iv-second} alongside analogous results estimated using propensity score matching and kernel matching approaches for comparison. We use a $z$-test to formally test for differences between the IV estimates and estimates from propensity score matching and kernel matching approaches. The propensity score matching (PSM) and kernel matching columns are marked with daggers, $\bm{\dagger}$, to denote rejection of the null of no difference between IV and comparison estimates at different significance levels.
