%\item Interpretation of results
Although the results described above do not present clear evidence that the Reggio Approach is an effective early childhood program when considering all comparisons and cohorts, there are some patterns that emerge. The most consistent result is that the Reggio Approach had positive effects on employment and mental health of the age-40 cohort, especially when comparing individuals who attended the Reggio Approach with other individuals in Reggio Emilia.

We consider the possibility that over time, even during the years for which the adult cohorts attended preschool, the programs grew to share more features. Under this scenario, the Reggio Approach and the alternatives would become more similar reducing the estimated treatment effects of the Reggio Approach.\footnote{See \citet{Elango_Hojman_etal_2016_Early-Edu} for a discussion of considering the counterfactual in early childhood education evaluations.} 

There is evidence of policies mandating the provision of early childhood education and encouraging certain guidelines with the aim of improving quality.\footnote{See Section~\ref{sec:eceexperiences} for a detailed discussion of these policies.} However, exact information on the trajectory of the systems attended by the individuals in our sample is not published to the best of the authors' knowledge. Our survey helps us understand the exact evolution of the programs' administrative and pedagogical components over time (see Appendix~\ref{sec:survey} for a full description of the survey). Using this survey to structure interviews with administrators in Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova, we investigated if the schools had aspects that are also present in the Reggio Approach schools, as well as details about their specific programs. 

To summarize, we present the similarities and differences between the different programs in Figures~\ref{fig:agg-admin} and~\ref{fig:agg-ped}. Using results from the structured interviews, we compute the number of administrative and pedagogical components that each program shares with the Reggio Approach by school type, city, and year. We examine 14 administrative components and 16 pedagogical components (not all of the pedagogical components were present in the Reggio Approach). Over time, many of the programs other than the state programs, adopted more features present in the Reggio Approach. This is especially true of the Parma municipal program when examining administrative components. The other programs did not adopt as many pedagogical components as they did administrative ones. Even though the Reggio Approach remained distinctive when considering the sum of its elements, many of the alternative schools evolved to include certain elements.

We emphasize the results of the survey for items that are related to prioritizing disadvantaged children. Municipal schools in the three cities shared priorities of enrolling economically disadvantaged children, children from a single-parent household, and children with disabilities. This is seen in our results given that controlling for more background characteristics makes the results more positive when comparing those who attended the Reggio Approach to other individuals in Reggio Emilia. 

These results are also similar in magnitude, and for adolescents and children similar in significance, to the PSM and AIPW results. Given that PSM and AIPW allow us to estimate the ATE correcting for bias from poor model specification and selection on observed characteristics, the similarity of estimates highlight that the background variables balance the sample between those who selected into the Reggio Approach and those who did not. Having more complete information on family characteristics, especially of the adult cohorts, might help improve this analysis further and better understand the nuances of the selection process. 

Finally, unearthed historical information to double check the assignment to different preschools and school types in the data, in addition to precisely characterizing the three cities (see Appendix~\ref{app:characteristics-cities}). Across the cohorts, the individuals (or their caregivers) were asked (i) what school the individual attended, (ii) that school's address, and (iii) the school's type (e.g. municipal). Many individuals were not able to supply all of this information, or supplied confounding information. One example is giving an address that does not match the school name. Paper records in Reggio Emilia and Padova detailing school enrollment helped us correct many of these issues. However, more detailed information on schools in Parma would help confirm that more of the sample is correctly assigned to the preschool program they attended.

These historical records also helped us construct Figure~\ref{fig:preschool-enroll}. These graphs show the enrollment rates since approximately 1970 in Reggio Emilia and Padova. During the time the age-40 cohort was in preschool, the enrollment rate was less than 1 in both Reggio Emilia and Padova. This helps explain the results found when comparing the age-40 individuals who attended the Reggio Approach to those who did not attend preschool in Padova. However, by approximately 1980, the enrollment rates in both Reggio Emilia and Padova hovered at 1.

\raggedright \footnotesize Note: These graphs show the trend in enrollment rates in Reggio Emilia and Padova over time. The series measuring preschool enrollment is not restricted to the 3-5 age group, and thus, is allowed to be greater than the series for total children 3-5. The enrollment proportion is occasionally greater than 1 in Padova due to this reason. See Appendix~\ref{app:characteristics-cities} for information on the sources used to construct these graphs.

This information provides evidence of the extent to which alternative preschools were available and utilized. Comparing a individuals who attended one preschool program to those who attended another one can result in few outcomes, especially if the alternative preschools offer quality education. In fact, when we compare adults who attended some types of preschool in Padova with adults who did not attend any preschool in Padova, the estimation results show that the preschool attendance in Padova has significantly positive effects on IQ, university graduation, obesity, and voting behaviors (See Appendix \ref{subsection:padova-estimation} for more specific results). This suggests that Padova had quality preschool education system from the 1970s.
