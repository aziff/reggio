The sample is a subset of the individuals in Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova who were born in the year ranges of the five cohorts.  These individuals were collected from the population registries in each of the cities. The sample was then restricted to those individuals living in the same city in which they were raised. All cohorts except the youngest one comprised only individuals who are Italian citizens. In contrast, the youngest cohort includes an oversampling of immigrant children.\footnote{In the adult cohorts there was no immigrant who was born in the any of the three cities and still lived there. In the adolescent cohort, the number was immigrant born was extremely small.} The sample from Reggio Emilia, across all cohorts, includes an oversampling of those who attended municipal schools, as this is the treatment group.

Of the reference sample, 7,109 individuals were randomly selected. Of these, 4,019 completed interviews, resulting in a response rate of 56.5\%. Figure~\ref{fig:sample} presents an overview of the sample highlighting those who attended a Reggio Approach preschool. Table~\ref{tab:sample} provides a detailed tabulation of the sample by city, cohort, and school type.

The bars for Reggio Emilia differentiate between those who attended municipal preschool (black bars) and those who did not (white bars). Those in Reggio Emilia who attended municipal preschools are considered the treatment group.}

Note: This table shows the sample size by city, cohort, and school type. These numbers do not include individuals with an unidentified preschool type. In total, there are 45 individuals with unidentified preschool type. We separate migrants and children for clarity in this table even though they are in the same birth cohort (year of birth: 2006). None: no preschool; Muni.: municipal preschool;  State: state preschool; Relig.: religious preschool; Priv.: private preschool.

The structure of the cohorts allows us to study the effects of the Reggio Approach at different points throughout the life cycle. The youngest cohort of children were interviewed when they entered primary school, the adolescent cohort when they ended compulsory schooling, and the adult cohorts capture different points of adulthood to measure key outcomes such as engagement in the labor market, health, and family decisions. This cohort structure also allows us to evaluate the Reggio Approach compared to the alternative early childhood experiences over time.

Separate questionnaires were administered to the children, adolescents, and adults. as well as to the caregivers of the children and adolescents. The questionnaires include items about early childhood experiences, family structure, education, interaction with non-Italians (or with Italians in the case of the migrant children), and measures of cognitive and social-emotional skills. The questionnaires for adults additionally included items about occupation, income, health, and life satisfaction.
