%Tables \ref{ols-E-reg} to \ref{ols-S-reg} show OLS estimate on the participation of the Reggio Approach preschools for people in Reggio who attended Reggio Approach preschools or no preschool at all. We do not include the age-50 cohort in this analysis, as the Reggio Approach did not exist for that cohort. We perform analysis using (i) no control, (ii) 6 controls selected by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and (iii) the full set of controls that include baseline variables available for the adult cohorts.
