%\item Interpretation of results
A clear pattern emerges from the results reported in the previous section. The estimates show that the benefits of attending Reggio Approach preschools relative to not attending any preschool are greater than the benefits of attending Reggio Approach preschools relative to attending alternative preschools. This pattern is true for both the age-30 and age-40 cohorts. However, the disparity is more pronounced for the older of the two cohorts. The pronounced difference in results for the age-40 cohort suggests that, at least for this cohort, the Reggio Approach was of sufficiently different quality that it improved outcomes of its students relative to those who did not attend preschool. However, the quality difference between the Reggio Approach and alternative programs was not sufficiently large to result in substantial positive differences in outcomes between these groups.

As previously noted, one possible explanation for this pattern is that over time the different preschools programs within Reggio Emilia and across Northern Italy improved their program quality and adopted administrative and pedagogical features that are the key features of the Reggio Approach. For instance, as noted in Section~\ref{sec:ece-italy}, religious preschools made significant efforts to improve their program quality in the 1990s by enhancing teacher training. Similarly, state preschools also improved their quality by decreasing teacher-child ratios in the 1990s. To the extent that these features improve later life outcomes, we should expect the commonalities of features to narrow the gap in outcomes between the Reggio Approach and alternative programs. This narrative is consistent with these results.

The evidence of beneficial effects for the older cohorts suggests that the story of diffusion better explains the broad pattern of evidence than the common founder story. Note, however, that diffusion appears to be rapid. An alternative explanation is that the different programs evolved from a common stimulus independent of the Reggio Approach because of common social and intellectual influences in Northern Italy. The three cities were in close geographical proximity to each other thereby, making it easier for ideas to be transmitted between the cities, and to influence by a common source of ideas and social action. Malaguzzi actively promoted his ideas in the 1960s and 1970s \citep{Cagliari-etal-eds_2016_BOOK_Loris-Malaguzzi}. In part, because of his activities, the Reggio Approach has received substantial publicity. This made it difficult for neighboring cities to ignore its features. It is also possible that there was reverse-diffusion. Perhaps important features were borrowed and adopted by Reggio Approach programs from non-Reggio Approach schools.

Our evidence suggests that the features of the progressive education model of the Reggio Approach not found in the comparison groups do not substantially contribute to boosting the studied outcomes. However, compared to no preschool, there are substantial beneficial effects of the Reggio Approach (and other approaches) on child welfare.

Our evaluation highlights concerns in program evaluation accounting for alternatives in control groups. Most controls receive alternative treatments. This problem is pervasive in the literature.\footnote{See \cite{Heckman_Hohmann_etal_2000_QJE} and \cite{Kline_Walters_2016_QJE}, who discuss substitution bias.} It would have been desirable to find control groups less likely to be influenced by the Reggio Approach. An extensive search was made within Italy but did not prove fruitful in locating more distant locations in Italy with characteristics similar to those in Reggio.

In addition, the response rate to the primary survey was low (roughly 56\%). The information available to us prevented us from adjusting for non-response. Similarly, outmigration rates in our cities are substantial, especially for the adolescent and adult cohorts. We were unable to find data on the outmigrants or to adjust for their characteristics. Selective migration and selective response likely bias our results, but in unknown ways. These selection indicators are similar across all three cities. Finally, the Reggio Approach emphasizes creativity and prioritization of enrollment for children with disabilities. We did not adequately survey creativity nor the determine the variation across programs in enrollment of children with disabilities

For all of these reasons, any conclusion about the effectiveness of the Reggio Approach must remain---at best---provisional. We clearly find that access to some form of infant-toddler care and preschool at the level found in Northern Italy is beneficial.

%As mentioned earlier, the Reggio Approach and the alternatives became increasingly similar over time, thereby, reducing the estimated treatment effects of the Reggio Approach with respect to these programs.\footnote{See \citet{Elango_Hojman_etal_2016_Early-Edu} for a discussion of considering the counterfactual in early childhood education evaluations.} Consistent with our expectations, we find a lack of significantly positive treatment effects for the child and adolescent cohorts. As Appendix Figure \ref{fig:enrollment} shows, almost all Italian children who were born after the 1990s have attended preschools. Since our analysis compares the Reggio Approach with other preschools in Northern Italy that are likely to have high-quality, it is difficult to find the treatment effect of the Reggio Approach \textit{per se}.


%There is evidence of national policies mandating the provision of early childhood education in all Italian cities, and encouraging certain guidelines with the aim of improving quality across the board. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, exact information on the quality and the trajectory of the systems attended by the individuals in our sample is not published. Our survey, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:ece-italy} helps us understand the exact evolution of the programs' administrative and pedagogical components over time (see Appendix~\ref{sec:survey} for a full description of the survey).

%Using this survey to structure interviews with administrators in Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova, we investigated if the schools had aspects that are also present in the Reggio Approach schools, as well as details about their specific programs.

%These results are similar in magnitude, and for adolescents and children similar in significance, to the PSM and AIPW results. Given that PSM and AIPW allow us to estimate the average treatment effect of the Reggio Approach correcting for bias from poor model specification and selection on observed characteristics, the similarity of estimates highlight that the background variables balance the sample between those who selected into the Reggio Approach and those who did not. Having more complete information on family characteristics, especially of the adult cohorts, might help improve this analysis further and better understand the nuances of the selection process.

%Finally, unearthed historical information to double check the assignment to different preschools and school types in the data, in addition to precisely characterizing the three cities (see Appendix~\ref{app:characteristics-cities}). Across the cohorts, the individuals (or their caregivers) were asked (i) what school the individual attended, (ii) that school's address, and (iii) the school's type (e.g. municipal). Many individuals were not able to supply all of this information, or supplied confounding information. One example is giving an address that does not match the school name. Paper records in Reggio Emilia and Padova detailing school enrollment helped us correct many of these issues. However, more detailed information on schools in Parma would help confirm that more of the sample is correctly assigned to the preschool program they attended.
%
%These historical records also helped us construct Figure~\ref{fig:preschool-enroll}. These graphs show the enrollment rates since approximately 1970 in Reggio Emilia and Padova. During the time the age-40 cohort was in preschool, the enrollment rate was less than 1 in both Reggio Emilia and Padova. This helps explain the results found when comparing the age-40 individuals who attended the Reggio Approach to those who did not attend preschool in Padova. However, by approximately 1980, the enrollment rates in both Reggio Emilia and Padova hovered at 1.

The series measuring preschool enrollment is not restricted to the 3-5 age group, and thus, is allowed to be greater than the series for total children 3-5. The enrollment proportion is occasionally greater than 1 in Padova due to this reason. See Appendix~\ref{app:characteristics-cities} for information on the sources used to construct these graphs.

%This information provides evidence of the extent to which alternative preschools were available and utilized. Comparing a individuals who attended one preschool program to those who attended another one can result in few outcomes, especially if the alternative preschools offer quality education. In fact, when we compare adults who attended some types of preschool in Padova with adults who did not attend any preschool in Padova, the estimation results show that the preschool attendance in Padova has significantly positive effects on IQ, university graduation, obesity, and voting behaviors for the age-30 cohort (See Appendix \ref{subsection:padova-estimation} for more specific results). This suggests that Padova had quality preschool education system from the 1970s.
