Because our study includes individuals who experienced the Reggio Approach as well as others who experienced other early childhood programs, it is important to examine the similarities and differences across the available programs. This section documents the Reggio Approach in addition to exploring the extent to which other programs adopted innovative features of the Reggio Approach at different points of time.

To increase our understanding of the evolution of the programs listed in Table~\ref{tab:itc-pre}, we collected historical records from Reggio Emilia and Padova\footnote{We were unsuccessful in sourcing historical records from Parma.} \citep{Padova-Admin-Data_1964-2011,Reggio-Admin-data_1966-2006,Reggio-Annual-Journals_1994-2011} and administered a survey to current and former school administrators and educative coordinators in order to quantify pedagogical and administrative features of early childhood programs available during 1950-2010 \citep{CEHD_2016_Historical-Analysis}.\footnote{See Appendix~\ref{sec:survey} for the survey.}

The survey was designed to explore the extent to which the key administrative and pedagogical components of the Reggio Approach were present in each city's state, religious, and municipal systems at different points of time. The components included in the survey were identified by published program descriptions and confirmed by scholars of the Reggio Approach and early childhood programs in Northern Italy.\footnote{See \citet{Edwards-etal-eds_1998_Hundred-Languages} and \citet{Corsaro_2008_Policy-Practice}.} The list of components includes various aspects of administrative program operations such as staffing, supervision, enrollment, and funding. It also considers pedagogy and educational practices for children's learning and parental engagement. Respondents were asked to indicate whether the central features of Reggio were present in their systems during different decades. Additional questions were included to understand a) extent of variation between municipal programs and private providers contracted by the municipality; b) extent of site-level variation within systems; c) perceived variation between similar systems in other cities; d) sources of program funding, and e) services for immigrant families.\footnote{For a more detailed summary of the items and the responses, see Appendix~\ref{sec:survey}.} Table~\ref{tab:respondents} identifies the school systems in each city that completed our survey.

\textbf{[JJH: Question, a separate survey for each program? Sylvi: Yes. Each program reported on their own services separately, and the same survey was sent to all programs, so that everyone was aware we were asking the same set of questions to each.]}

Results from the historical survey indicate that early childhood education systems within Reggio Emilia, as well as in Parma and Padova, share a number of similar characteristics. These include features of program administration, various pedagogical methods, and practices for at-risk children and families. The general trend shows that programming and practices endorsed by the municipality of Reggio Emilia are increasingly present in other early childhood systems, albeit to different degrees and at different times. We interpret these results as evidence supporting spillovers of Reggio features into other early childhood programs. \textbf{[Team: We are cautious about strong claims of spillovers, as our survey data indicates that other programs were not influenced by Malaguzzi or the Reggio Approach.]} We acknowledge the small sample of survey respondents is too limited to ensure reliability or validity of outcomes. We further acknowledge the design of our historical survey limits our ability to capture strengths and uniquenesses of alternative approaches. We caution that the evidence from our survey should not be interpreted as a quality measure of early childhood systems.

To summarize our findings, we compare the different programs in Figures~\ref{fig:agg-admin} and~\ref{fig:agg-ped}. A more detailed description is provided in the section that follows. Using survey results, we calculate the number of administrative and pedagogical components that each program shared with the Reggio Approach by school type, city, and year. We examine 14 administrative components and 16 pedagogical components (not all of the pedagogical components were present in the Reggio Approach). Over time, many of the programs increasingly implemented pedagogical and administrative practices endorsed by the Reggio Approach. This is especially true for Parma's municipal program, and somewhat true for Padova's municipal program. The other systems did not adopt as many pedagogical components as they did administrative ones. Even though the Reggio Approach remains distinctive when considering the sum of its elements, many of the alternative schools evolved to include a substantial portion of the elements in Reggio Emilia's municipal system.

\subsection{Municipal Schools in Reggio Emilia - The Reggio Approach}

Reggio Emilia's investment in innovative programming, staffing, and provision of broad early childhood services, known collectively as the Reggio Approach, is notable for being one of the earliest municipal systems in Italy. Reggio Emilia constructed its first preschool for children aged 3-6 years in 1963. In 1965, the municipality legislated funding for infant-toddler centers for children aged 3 to 36 months; the first center opened in 1971. The Reggio Approach thus preceded Italy's key educational reforms of 1968 and 1971 legislating free state preschools and local provision of infant-toddler childcare \citep{Cagliari-etal-eds_2016_BOOK_Loris-Malaguzzi}. Relative to Parma and Padova, Reggio Emilia historically offers the largest number of municipal infant-toddler and preschool sites.\footnote{Similar to Parma and Padova, Reggio Emilia contracts with local private providers and cooperatives to offer infant-toddler and preschool slots according to municipal regulations. These ``affiliated'' programs may not follow the Reggio Approach nor the municipal approaches in Parma and Padova. Accordingly, we consider this a separate sample during analysis.} 

At the heart of the Reggio Approach is a stated purpose to meet the rights of children and needs of young families. For example, engagement of families \textbf{[JJH: What does this mean? What is engagement? Sylvi: Please note revised text.]} in municipal centers is embedded in its policies and practices. Municipal preschools and infant-toddler centers are open five full-time days per week from September through June \citep{Giudici-Nicolosi_2014_Reggio-Approach}. Some sites offer programming in July and extended day options are available at a majority of sites throughout the school year to accommodate working parents. Reggio Approach schools prioritize admission for economically disadvantaged and single-parent families, as well as children with physical and learning disabilities \citep{Edwards-etal-eds_1998_Hundred-Languages}. Parents and community members are invited to participate in school management and shape school policies, volunteer in the classroom, and host field trips in the community \citep{CEHD_2016_Historical-Analysis,Cagliari-etal-eds_2016_BOOK_Loris-Malaguzzi}.

In Reggio Approach centers, the environment reflects a light-filled, open interior design, furnished with natural materials and a garden. In-house kitchens are surrounded by glass walls, to include children in the meal process, and is used daily for preparing meals. Each preschool is equipped with an atelier, or dedicated studio laboratory, where children and educators collaborate on creative instructional activities. In preschools, incoming 3-year old cohorts form a homogenous classroom of about 25 children. Cohorts are assigned two full-time co-teachers (1:12-13). Teachers observe children's development, interact with children through questions and dialogue, and provide scaffolding to support learning. At least 1 of the 2 teachers remains with each cohort for three consecutive years. offering extended time for continuity of care and strong teacher-family engagement. Each preschool site is further staffed by a full-time atelierista, an instructor with a background in visual arts, who helps teachers develop creative learning activities. A pedagogista, or educational coordinator, with a post-BA \textbf{[JJH: Post-BA? Sylvi: Depending on the decade, either a BA or a diploma from a post-high school teaching program.]} in psychology or education is assigned to support professional development on a biweekly basis for the educational staff of approximately 4-5 municipal preschools. Auxiliary site staff, such as cooks and janitors, are considered members of the educational team and participate in the biweekly trainings.

The Reggio Approach was shaped by Loris Malaguzzi, an educator and psychologist influenced by Dewey, Vygotsky, and the psychological theories of Piaget and Erikson. \textbf{[JJH: Do we know this? Sylvi: These four theorists are confirmed by our survey and cited in Cagliari 2016. We also ask about Bronfenbrenner, Kagan, and Gardner as influences on the Reggio Approach in our survey. We propose they appear in the Memo as our survey results indicate their influence on other programs.]} As a model of progressive early childhood education, there is no institutionally-prescribed content knowledge that educators convey to children to achieve the goal of ``school readiness.'' In contrast to education that prioritizes content-learning over process-learning, the Reggio Approach views curriculum as an ongoing, collaborative project between educators, children and families, with emergent learning goals and flexible project timelines. Adults and children function as researchers and co-creators of knowledge, collaborating to define a question or topic of study. Learning is then pursued following the scientific process: theories are shared, tested, and revised through socratic questions and dialogue. \textbf{[JJH: But this is a method -- select a project and review. Sylvi: I agree. Reggio's curriculum is more method than content (in contrast to state, religious, and the other municipal programs which focus more on content). We now state this more explicitly.]} Children demonstrate their emerging knowledge through expressive art forms, with aid from the atelierista, and verbally present learning to classroom peers. Teachers document each child's work in a portfolio that is shared with children and parents over the year to observe the child's development \citep{Rinaldi_2006_ReggioEmilia_BOOK,Giudici-Nicolosi_2014_Reggio-Approach}. 

\subsection{Municipal Schools in Parma and Padova}

The provision of programs and services for early childhood in Parma and Padova are currently, and historically, smaller compared to that of Reggio Emilia. Further, the focus on early childhood education education in Parma and Padova emerged long after Reggio Emilia developed its model. Parma's investment in early childhood education consolidated around 1975, by which time Reggio Emilia offered 20 municipal preschools \citep{Giudici-Nicolosi_2014_Reggio-Approach}. In Padova, investment into high quality educational programming by the municipality did not occur until the mid-1980s, when the Reggio Approach was offered in 21 municipal preschools and 13 infant-toddler centers \citep{Giudici-Nicolosi_2014_Reggio-Approach}. For additional information, see (see Appendix Table~\ref{tab:educ-program}). 

Survey results indicate that the municipal early childhood programs in Parma and Padova are somewhat different from each other and from the municipal schools in Reggio Emilia. For example, similar to the Reggio Approach, Parma and Padova both assigned importance to helping at-risk families\footnote{These families include those of a low economic status, those with a single parent, and children with a disability.}, by offering services that helped such families (e.g., offering extended hours), and by prioritizing enrollment for children from these families (see Appendix Table~\ref{tab:administrative-atrisk}). Starting in the 2000s, Parma and Padova's municipal programs were influenced by the same academic theories of psychology and early childhood education as Reggio Emilia and began to document children's learning (see Appendix Table~\ref{tab:educ-program}). 

Where the municipal systems in Parma and Padova differ considerably from the Reggio Approach is in the implementation of these theories. In Parma and Padova's municipal systems, a pre-defined program is implemented to guide children in learning specific concepts such as communication, culture, order, measure, space, time, nature, self, and other \textbf{[JJH: Such as? Sylvi: The program concepts are intentionally vague in order to be actualized at the individual school-level, similar to Head Start. (In contrast, in Reggio, chosen concepts are not pre-determined but follow the child's lead.)]} Furthermore, religious instruction is provided. Neither of these educational approaches are present in the Reggio Approach (see Appendix Table~\ref{tab:educ-program}).  \textbf{[JJH: Why inconsistent? Sylvi: Apologies, I'm unsure what inconsistency you refer to.]}

\subsection{State Preschools}

Historical records indicate that state preschools first appeared in Reggio Emilia and in Padova between 1973-1975 \citep{Padova-Admin-Data_1964-2011,Reggio-Admin-data_1966-2006,Reggio-Annual-Journals_1994-2011}. By 1968 law regarding the offer and funding of free, public preschools, Italy provides early childhood education -- only where local demand is not already met by existing non-state (i.e. municipal and religious) systems \citep{Hohnerlein_2009_Paradox-Public-Preschools}.\footnote{In state programs, parents pay only for meals, transportation, and extras such as field trips and extracurricular lessons. Although the state does not offer infant-toddler childcare, it regulates and subsidizes these programs through regional governments.} This policy, in light of the earlier investment by Reggio Emilia and large offer of religious childcare in Padova, resulted in a disparate supply of state preschools in Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova. Moreover, while the state became Italy's largest provider of preschool education, enrollment in state programs of Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova lagged behind municipal and religious programs between 1970 and 2010. 

Reports suggest that state policies and Orientamenti were historically influenced by municipal programs from the region of Emilia Romagna, including Reggio Emilia, Milan, and Pistoia \citep{OECD_2001_Italy-Country-Note}. Periodic improvements to Orientamenti, along with revised mandates for lower teacher-child ratios and higher qualifications for teacher education, are proposed as key quality indicators associated with diminishing disparities in state and non-state programs by the end of the 20th century \citep{Hohnerlein_2015_Development-and-Diffusion}. For example, teacher-child ratios were very low for the three adult cohorts ranging from 27 to 36 children aged 3-5 years per teacher \textbf{[JJH: At what age and over what period? Sylvi: We have revised the text to answer these questions]}. Attendees of state preschools in the adolescent cohort experienced a 1:17 teacher-child ratio. In the child cohort, teacher-child ratios in state preschools was equivalent to that of the Reggio Approach \citep{Hohnerlein_2015_Development-and-Diffusion}. 

Despite improved teacher-child ratios and teacher requirements in state preschools over time, survey results indicate that the many aspects of administration and pedagogy of state preschools are different from the Reggio Approach and from municipal programs in Parma, and Padova. For example, state preschools do not offer extended hours to working families, thus state teachers work shorter hours than their municipal counterparts. State preschools do not have full-time Pedagogistas to oversee programs, do not have an expert in the creative arts, and do not set aside time for teachers to engage families (see Appendix Table \ref{tab:programoperation}). 

Moreover, in contrast to the Reggio Approach, state preschools have a different approach to support children's learning. State programs are influenced by different academic theories, pedagogy includes religious teaching, direct instruction, and the use of worksheets. Daily activities follow a program to guide children in learning of specific concepts (see Appendix Table~\ref{tab:educ-program}). Survey results indicate that state preschools in Padova are similar to those in Reggio Emilia, except that funding is provided by the municipality of Reggio Emilia for children in local state preschools to experience community field trips as a learning activity (see Appendix Tables~\ref{tab:programoperation} - \ref{tab:environ-features}).

\subsection{Religious Preschools}

Religious preschools were available to all families in our evaluation, however, in varying numbers in each of the three cities. The Catholic Church is the oldest early childhood provider in Italy, offering both religious training and charitable social services for disadvantaged children since the 19th century \citep{OECD_2001_Italy-Country-Note}. While the Church does not offer educational infant-toddler programs, as in the Reggio Approach, nor implement a unified system of religious preschool education, religious institutions began to assemble local federations in the mid-1970s. Within federations, distinct religious sites are enabled to function autonomously and offer independent programming.

Following a 1997 policy mandating state funding for non-state programs that met national early childhood guidelines, the Catholic Church undertook significant efforts to quantify and achieve equitable program quality \citep{Malizia-Cicatelli_2011_BOOK_Catholic-School}. For example, religious educators were replaced with secular teachers trained in secular academic institutions. Teacher-child ratios were also greatly improved to reflect national standards. Parents of the youngest cohort in our sample, born in 2006, who enrolled in equitable religious programs were eligible for subsidized tuition on a sliding-scale basis, and their children experienced educational programming that reflected the influence of municipal systems in Emilia Romagna, including Reggio Emilia \citep{Hohnerlein_2009_Paradox-Public-Preschools,OECD_2001_Italy-Country-Note}. For example, while religious programs historically did not provide infant-toddler education, by the late 1990's, some sites in each of the three cities began to offer transitional programming for children aged 24 months \citep{Malizia-Cicatelli_2011_BOOK_Catholic-School,CEHD_2016_Historical-Analysis}.

Survey results for religious preschools are only available for Padova. It is shown that religious preschools in Padova share following the components in program operations with the Reggio Approach: from the 1970s, weekly time is set aside for teachers to engage families \textbf{[JJH: How and for how long? Sylvi: We don't have this data for the 70s and 80s. For the 90s and 2000s, by keeping teachers with the same cohort for 3 years and through ``parental education' (which is undefined). The amount of weekly time is unknown.]}, and from 1980s, for teachers to document children's work. Parental boards are actively engaged in the school culture from the 1970s (see Appendix Table \ref{tab:programoperation}). Padova's religious schools give priority to enrollment to children with disabilities since the 1990s, but they do not prioritize the enrollment of children from economically disadvantaged families, which is unlike the Reggio Approach (see Appendix Table \ref{tab:administrative-atrisk}). Padova's religious schools have an atelier from the 1980s (see Appendix Table \ref{tab:environ-features}). Finally, like state programs and municipal systems in Parma and Padova, and unlike the Reggio Approach, religious preschools in Padova provide religious teaching and follow a daily program to guide children in learning specific concepts (see Appendix Table \ref{tab:educ-program}).
