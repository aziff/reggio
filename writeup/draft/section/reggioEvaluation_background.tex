Our study compares individuals who experienced the Reggio Approach with those who experienced other Northern Italian early childhood programs, as well as some who undertook no program at all. In this section, we examine the similarities and differences across the available programs, both contemporaneously and historically. This section documents the Reggio Approach in addition to exploring the extent to which other programs offer features of the Reggio Approach at different points of time.

To increase our understanding of the evolution of the programs listed in Table~\ref{tab:itc-pre}, we collected historical records from Reggio Emilia and Padova. We were unsuccessful in sourcing historical records from Parma, although we obtained information on contemporary content. \citep{Padova-Admin-Data_1964-2011,Reggio-Admin-data_1966-2006,Reggio-Annual-Journals_1994-2011} and administered a survey to current and former school administrators and educative coordinators in order to quantify pedagogical and administrative features of early childhood programs available during 1950-2010 \citep{CEHD_2016_Historical-Analysis}. See Appendix~\ref{sec:survey} for the survey.

The survey was designed to explore the extent to which the key administrative and pedagogical components of the Reggio Approach were present in each city's state, religious, and municipal systems at different points of time. The components included in the survey were identified by published program descriptions and confirmed by scholars of the Reggio Approach and early childhood programs in Northern Italy.\footnote{See \citet{Edwards-etal-eds_1998_Hundred-Languages} and \citet{Corsaro_2008_Policy-Practice}.} The list of components includes various aspects of administrative program operations such as staffing, supervision, enrollment, and funding. It also considers pedagogy and educational practices for children's learning and parental engagement. Respondents were asked to indicate whether central features of Reggio were present in their systems during different decades. Additional questions were included to understand a) the extent of variation between municipal programs and private providers contracted by the municipality; b) the extent of site-level variation within systems; c) the perceived variation between similar systems in other cities; d) the sources of program funding, and e) the services available for immigrant families.\footnote{For a more detailed summary of the items and the responses, see Appendix~\ref{sec:survey}.} Table~\ref{tab:respondents} identifies the school systems in each city that completed our survey.

\textbf{[JJH: Flatten table.]}

Results from the survey indicate that early childhood education systems within Reggio Emilia, as well as in Parma and Padova, share a number of similar characteristics. These include features of program administration, various pedagogical methods, and practices for at-risk children and families. The general trend shows that programming and practices endorsed by the municipality of Reggio Emilia are present in other early childhood systems, albeit to different degrees and at different times. We interpret these results as evidence supporting spillovers of the features of Reggio into other early childhood programs. The evidence is also consistent with a common influence operating at the onset of these programs. The evidence mildly supports a spillover story because any effects found are for the oldest cohorts of particpants. \textbf{[JJH: How can a survey reveal spillovers or not?]} We acknowledge that the small sample of survey respondents may be too limited to ensure reliable answers.

We compare the different programs in Figures~\ref{fig:agg-admin} and~\ref{fig:agg-ped}. A more detailed description is provided in the section that follows. Using survey results, we calculate the number of administrative and pedagogical components that each program shared with the Reggio Approach by school type, city, and year. We examine 14 administrative components and 16 pedagogical components (not all of the pedagogical components were present in the Reggio Approach). Over time, many of the programs implemented more and more of the pedagogical and administrative practices endorsed by the Reggio Approach. This is especially true for Parma's municipal program, and true to a somewhat lesser extent for Padova's municipal program. The other systems did not adopt as many pedagogical components as they did administrative ones. Even though the Reggio Approach remains distinctive when considering the sum of its elements, many of the alternative schools evolved to include a substantial portion of the elements in Reggio Emilia's municipal system.

\subsection{Municipal Schools in Reggio Emilia - The Reggio Approach}

Of the municipal systems in Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova, the Reggio Approach is notable for innovative programming \textbf{[JJH: Innovative how? Please cut the bombast. Earlier we say we have no historical data on Parma -- now suddenly we do. Which is correct?]}, investment in staffing, and broad provision of early childhood services. Of the three, it was the earliest municipal system to evolve and historically offers \textbf{[JJH: What is an historical offer?]} the largest number of municipal infant-toddler and preschool sites.\footnote{Similar to Parma and Padova, Reggio Emilia contracts with local private providers and cooperatives to offer infant-toddler and preschool slots according to municipal regulations. These ``affiliated'' programs may not follow the Reggio Approach nor the municipal approaches in Parma and Padova. Accordingly, we consider this a separate sample during analysis.} Reggio Emilia's municipal early childhood system preceded Italy's key educational reforms of 1968 and 1971 legislating free state preschools and local provision of infant-toddler childcare \citep{Cagliari-etal-eds_2016_BOOK_Loris-Malaguzzi}. \textbf{[JJH: Can we say that Reggio actually influenced reforms?]}

The Reggio Approach is a form of progressive early childhood education shaped by Loris Malaguzzi, a psychologist and educator influenced by Dewey's model of progressive education, Vygotsky, and psychological theories of Piaget and Erikson. \textbf{[JJH: Do we know this?] [Sylvi: These four theorists are confirmed by our survey and cited in Cagliari 2016. We also ask about Bronfenbrenner, Kagan, and Gardner as influences on the Reggio Approach in our survey. We propose they appear in the Memo as our survey results indicate their influence on other programs.] [JJH: If we do this, please give me a citation. Talk is cheap and people rationalize what they did, see e.g., the Perry teacher survey. Did Reggio evolve? Gardner could not have had an effect.]} Under Malaguzzi's direction, Reggio Emilia constructed its first preschool for children aged 3-6 years in 1963. In 1965, the municipality legislated funding for infant-toddler centers for children aged 3 to 36 months; the first center opened in 1971.

In Reggio Approach schools, there is no institutionally-prescribed content knowledge that educators are asked to convey to children to achieve the goal of ``school readiness,'' or any other such goal. Curriculum is viewed as an ongoing, collaborative project between educators, children and families, with emergent learning goals and flexible project timelines. Adults and children are researchers and co-creators of knowledge. For example, adults and children collaborate to define a question or topic. Learning is then pursued following a scientific process: theories are shared, tested, and revised through socratic questions and dialogue. \textbf{[JJH: Reggio's curriculum is more method than content (in contrast to state, religious, and the other municipal programs which focus more on content). But this is not shared by other schools? How do we know?]} Children demonstrate their emerging knowledge through expressive art forms, with aid from the atelierista. Teachers document each child's work in a portfolio that is shared with children and parents over the year to observe the child's development \citep{Rinaldi_2006_ReggioEmilia_BOOK,Giudici-Nicolosi_2014_Reggio-Approach}

In Reggio preschools, incoming 3-year old cohorts form a homogenous classroom of about 25 children. Cohorts are assigned two full-time co-teachers (teacher-pupil ratios are 1:12-13) \textbf{[JJH: Seems high!]}. Teachers observe children's development, interact with children through questions and dialogue, and provide scaffolding to support learning. At least 1 of the 2 teachers remains with each cohort for three consecutive years. offering extended time for continuity of care and strong teacher-family engagement. Each preschool site is further staffed by a full-time atelierista, an instructor with a background in visual arts, who helps teachers develop creative learning activities. A pedagogista, or educational coordinator, with a post-BA \textbf{[JJH: Post-BA?] [Sylvi: Depending on the decade, either a BA or a diploma from a post-high school teaching program.] [JJH: Be specific!]} in psychology or education is assigned to support professional development on a biweekly basis for the educational staff of approximately 4-5 municipal preschools. Auxiliary site staff, such as cooks and janitors, are considered members of the educational team and participate in the biweekly trainings.

School environments reflect a light-filled, open interior design, furnished with natural materials and a garden. In-house kitchens are surrounded by glass walls, to include children in the meal preparation process, and is used daily for preparing meals. Each preschool is equipped with an atelier, or dedicated studio laboratory, where children and educators collaborate on creative instructional activities.

The engagement of families \textbf{[JJH: What does this mean? What is engagement?] [Sylvi: Please note revised text.]} is embedded in Reggio Approach practices. Preschools and infant-toddler centers are open five full-time days per week from September through June \citep{Giudici-Nicolosi_2014_Reggio-Approach}. Some sites offer programming in July and extended day options are available at a majority of sites throughout the school year to accommodate working parents. Reggio Approach schools prioritize admission for children of single parents and children with disabilities \citep{Edwards-etal-eds_1998_Hundred-Languages}. Parents and community members are invited to participate in school management and shape school policies, volunteer in the classroom, and host field trips in the community \citep{CEHD_2016_Historical-Analysis,Cagliari-etal-eds_2016_BOOK_Loris-Malaguzzi}.

\subsection{Municipal Schools in Parma and Padova}

\textbf{[JJH: This section is very weak and hurts the paper.]}

The municipal early childhood systems in Parma and Padova emerged after Reggio Emilia designed the Reggio Approach. Both systems are currently, and were historically, smaller than that of Reggio Emilia. Parma's municipal early childhood system consolidated and expanded around 1975, about a decade after that of Reggio Emilia. While Padova offered five municipal sites by 1976, investment into high quality educational programming by the municipality did not occur until the mid-1980s. For additional information, see (see Appendix Table~\ref{tab:educ-program}).

Although the municipal systems in Parma and Padova are somewhat different from each other and from the municipal schools in Reggio Emilia, they share many features in common. Results from the survey indicate that the municipal schools in Parma and Padova also assigned importance to helping at-risk families\footnote{These families include those of a low economic status, those with a single parent, and children with a disability.} by offering services that helped such families (e.g., offering extended hours) and by prioritizing enrollment for children from these families (see Appendix Table~\ref{tab:administrative-atrisk}).

Starting in the 2000s \textbf{[JJH: It is only in the 2000s. What is the evidence?]}, Parma and Padova's municipal systems were influenced by the same academic theories of psychology and early childhood education as Reggio Emilia and teachers began to document children's learning (see Appendix Table~\ref{tab:educ-program}). However, the municipal systems in Parma and Padova differ considerably from the Reggio Approach in the implementation of these theories. In Parma and Padova's municipal systems, religious instruction is provided. Furthermore, a pre-defined program is implemented to guide children in learning specific concepts such as communication, culture, order, measure, space, time, nature, self, and other \textbf{[JJH: Such as? Sylvi: The program concepts are intentionally vague in order to be actualized at the individual school-level, similar to Head Start. (In contrast, in Reggio, chosen concepts are not pre-determined but follow the child's lead.)]} Neither of these educational components are present in the Reggio Approach (see Appendix Table~\ref{tab:educ-program}).  \textbf{[JJH: Why inconsistent?] [Sylvi: Apologies, I'm unsure what inconsistency you refer to.] [JJH: This has to stop. It's obvious what I said. Knowing order, space, time, etc. is not consistent with Reggio. There is no head to head comparison. It looks like Sylvi swallowed Reggio propaganda hook, line, and sink.]}.

\subsection{State Preschools}

State preschools are mandated by 1968 law regarding the provision and funding of free, public preschools -- only where local demand was not already met by existing non-state systems \citep{Hohnerlein_2009_Paradox-Public-Preschools}.\footnote{In state programs, parents pay only for meals, transportation, and extras such as field trips and extracurricular lessons. Although the state does not offer infant-toddler childcare, it regulates and subsidizes these programs through regional governments.} \textbf{[JJH: Discuss features of the 1968 literature.]} This policy resulted in disparate numbers of state preschools in Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova for each of the cohorts in our evaluation. Historical records indicate that state preschools first appeared in Reggio Emilia and Padova between 1973-1975 \citep{Padova-Admin-Data_1964-2011,Reggio-Admin-data_1966-2006,Reggio-Annual-Journals_1994-2011}. In contrast to other areas of Italy where the state is currently the largest provider of preschool education, enrollment in Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova's state preschools has historically lagged behind municipal and religious programs. \textbf{[JJH: What is municipal and what is municipal preschool?]}

Reports suggest that policies and guidelines for state schools (Orientamenti) were historically influenced by municipal programs from the region of Emilia Romagna, including Reggio Emilia, Milan, and Pistoia \citep{OECD_2001_Italy-Country-Note}. Periodic improvements to state Orientamenti, along with revised mandates for lower teacher-child ratios and higher qualifications for teacher education, are proposed as key quality indicators associated with diminishing disparities in state and non-state programs by the end of the 20th century \citep{Hohnerlein_2015_Development-and-Diffusion}. For example, child/teacher ratios were very high for the three adult cohorts ranging from 27 to 36 children aged 3-5 years per teacher. Attendees of state preschools in the adolescent cohort experienced a 1:17 teacher-child ratio. In the child cohort, teacher-child ratios in state preschools was equivalent to that of the Reggio Approach \citep{Hohnerlein_2015_Development-and-Diffusion}.

The results from the survey indicate that the programming and operations of state preschools in Reggio Emilia are different from the Reggio Approach and municipal programs in Parma, and Padova. State preschools do not offer extended hours to working families. State teachers work shorter hours than their municipal counterparts. State preschools do not have full-time Pedagogistas to oversee programs, do not have an expert in the creative arts, and do not set aside time for teachers to engage families (see Appendix Table \ref{tab:programoperation}). Moreover, state preschools in Reggio Emilia have a different approach to support children's learning compared to the Reggio Approach in that the program is  influenced by different academic theories, religious teaching is provided, and daily activities follow a program to guide children in learning of specific concepts. In contrast, the Reggio Approach is based on research-based projects with unlimited timelines (see Appendix Table~\ref{tab:educ-program}). The survey results also indicate that state preschools in Padova are similar to those in Reggio Emilia, except that they provided professional development from the 1990s (see Appendix Tables~\ref{tab:programoperation} - \ref{tab:environ-features}). Our study evaluated whether these additional features of Reggio have any benefits. They appear not to.

\subsection{Religious Preschools}

The Catholic Church is the oldest early childhood provider in Italy, offering both religious training and charitable social services for disadvantaged children since the 19th century \citep{OECD_2001_Italy-Country-Note}. While the Church does not offer educational infant-toddler programs, as in the Reggio Approach, nor does it implement a unified system of religious preschool education, religious institutions began to assemble local federations in the mid-1970s. Within federations, distinct religious sites are enabled to offer independent programs. \textbf{[JJH: Churches? What's a site? Church? What is the content of the program?]}

Following a 1997 policy providing state funding for non-state programs (i.e., municipal and religious) that met national guidelines for early childhood, the Catholic Church undertook significant efforts to quantify and achieve equitable program quality \citep{Malizia-Cicatelli_2011_BOOK_Catholic-School}. For example, religious educators were replaced with secular teachers trained in higher institutions and teacher-child ratios were greatly reduced to reflect national standards. Parents of the youngest cohort in our sample, born in 2006, who enrolled in equitable religious programs were eligible for subsidized tuition on a sliding-scale basis, and their children experienced educational programming that reflected an influence by municipal systems in Emilia Romagna, including Reggio Emilia \citep{Hohnerlein_2009_Paradox-Public-Preschools,OECD_2001_Italy-Country-Note}. For example, while religious programs historically did not provide infant-toddler education, by the late 1990's, some sites in each of the three cities began to offer transitional programming for children aged 24 months \citep{Malizia-Cicatelli_2011_BOOK_Catholic-School,CEHD_2016_Historical-Analysis}.

Survey results for religious preschools are only available for Padova. It is shown that religious preschools in Padova share following the components in program operations with the Reggio Approach: from the 1970s, weekly time is set aside for teachers to engage families. Like Reggio, the same teacher stays with a cohort of children. There is active engagement of parents. From 1980s, teachers document children's work. Parental boards are actively engaged in the school culture from the 1970s (see Appendix Table \ref{tab:programoperation}). Padova's religious schools give priority to enrollment to children with disabilities since the 1990s, but they do not prioritize the enrollment of children from economically disadvantaged families, which is unlike the Reggio Approach (see Appendix Table \ref{tab:administrative-atrisk}). Padova's religious schools have had an atelier from the 1980s (see Appendix Table \ref{tab:environ-features}). However, unlike the Reggio Approach, Padova's religious preschools provide religious teaching and follow a daily program to guide children in learning specific concepts (see Appendix Table \ref{tab:educ-program}). This appears to have no effects for the measures we study.

\subsection{Summary}

On many key features, Reggio is no longer unique, if it ever was. The evidence summarized here supports the empirical work, which we report next.
