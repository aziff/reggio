We first list the different types of early childhood systems and policies in Italy. We then describe the Reggio Approach, which we consider to be the treatment in this evaluation. Because those who did not receive this treatment did not receive a homogenous alternative early childhood education experiences, we also document the curricular and administrative elements of these alternative programs. 

In order to understand more about the evolution of the different systems apart from what was available in the literature, we conducted a survey asking about specific components seen in the schools of Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova. See Section~\ref{sec:discussion} for a discussion of the survey results and Appendix~\ref{sec:survey} for a detailed description of the survey and its implementation.

\subsection{Types of Early Childhood Education in Italy}

Italy's current system of early education follows key state laws passed in 1968 and 1971, regulating programs according to children's age. Infant-toddler programs target children up to 3 years of age, and preschool programs for children ages 3-6 years.\footnote{Current ECE reform efforts seek to unify the system of early childhood education to provide continuity of care from 0-6 years.} 

Infant-toddler care and preschool are not uniformly offered by the different programs. The state offers preschool education only. Municipalities offer both preschool and infant-toddler programs; eligible age of entry varies by municipality from 3 months to 9 months. The Catholic Church offers the majority of non-state, religious preschool; some religious sites offer programming for children beginning at 24 months. Some municipalities contract with private providers of programs for both 0-3 and 3-6 years to enable provision of childcare slots to meet local demand.

The responsibilities for regulating and funding preschool and infant-toddler childcare are as follows: the state passes laws, defines educational aims, and provides the majority of funding for preschools to regions. Each region regulates and distributes funding to the non-state preschool programs within that region. 

Municipalities organize and subsidize local early childhood systems, which are required by the state to provide childcare slots to meet the demand of all families. By 1990, over 96\% of Italian children aged 3-6 years attended preschool. In contrast, provision of infant-toddler childcare varies considerably across Italy; some municipalities in Northern Italy meet the childcare demand for 30-45\% of families with children under age 3 years, compared to to 2.3\% in the South \citep{Becchi-Ferrari_1990_Pub-Inf-Centres-Italy,Musatti-Picchio_2010_IJEC}. 

Municipalities and other non-state programs are enabled to design autonomous curricula and set administrative regulations such as eligibility criteria for municipal infant-toddler centers and preschools. Although selection criteria are similar across municipalities, the weighting of distinct family characteristics varies \citep{Del-Boca-etal_2016_CESifo-ES}. Children of working mothers generally receive priority enrollment by municipal systems \citep{Saraceno_1984_Soc-Probs}.

Fees to attend municipal preschools vary: about half of municipalities provide free preschool while others are offered on a sliding scale. State preschools are free to all families, however, families are responsible for meals and extra programming such as field trips. In contrast, parental fees for municipal infant-toddler care are much higher, covering 21\% of total program costs on average \citep{Musatti-Picchio_2010_IJEC}. Until 1997-2000, private preschools were considered ``schools for the rich'' with tuition purely the family's responsibility \citep{Ribolzi_2013_Italy}. After 2000, state policies were revised to acknowledge non-state schools (municipal and religious) that complied with eight specific regulations, enabling public funding for ``equitable'' preschools. Tuition for religious preschools still depend on family income. This is because the amount of public subsidies for non-state schools vary as decided by the municipality \citep{Hohnerlein_2009_Paradox-Public-Preschools,Ribolzi_2013_Italy}.

To summarize, early childhood education in Italy is publicly provided by the municipality or the state, and privately provided by religious institutions and secular non-profits organizations. Section~\ref{sec:data} describes the selection of our sample into these different school types.

\subsection{The Reggio Approach}

The Reggio Approach is a form of municipal early childhood education designed by Loris Malaguzzi, an educator influenced by the educational practices and psychological theories of Dewey, Piaget, Erikson, Vygotsky, Bronfenbrenner, Kagan, and Gardner. Malaguzzi, along with Bruno Ciari in Bologna, was one of several left-wing educators within the region of Emilia Romagna who were influenced by these progressive models of education. Under the guidance of Malaguzzi, Reggio Emilia opened its first preschool in 1963 for children aged 3-6 years. In 1965, Reggio Emilia passed laws regulating funding for the first infant-toddler center for children aged 3 months to 3 years which opened in 1971. The Reggio Emilia municipal early childhood system thus preceded Italy's legislative reforms in the 1960s and 1970s that established state-run preschools and mandated the local provision of infant-toddler centers \citep{Cagliari-etal-eds_2016_BOOK_Loris-Malaguzzi}. 

In the Reggio Approach preschools, the educative team is assigned specialized roles. Each incoming class of 3-year-olds is assigned two full-time co-teachers who remain with this cohort of same-aged children for three consecutive years. This extended time provides continuity of care for children and enables strong teacher-family engagement. Each school site is further staffed by a full-time atelierista, an instructor with a background in visual arts. Auxiliary site staff, such as cooks and janitors, are considered members of the educative team and participate in trainings and professional development. A pedagogista---or educative coordinator---with a higher degree in psychology or education is assigned to support professional development on a biweekly basis for the educative staff of approximately 4-5 municipal preschools. 

The Reggio Approach is notable for viewing curriculum as an ongoing, collaborative project without pre-determined learning goals or timelines. There is no institutionally-prescribed content knowledge that educators convey to children for ``school readiness.'' In contrast, teachers and children are viewed as researchers and co-creators of knowledge. For example, educators, children and families collaborate to define a question or topic. Learning is then pursued following a scientific process: theories are shared, tested, and revised through dialogue. Teachers observe children's development, interact with children through questions and dialogue, and provide scaffolding to support learning. Children demonstrate their emerging knowledge through creative visual media with aid from the atelierista. Teachers document each child's development in a portfolio---a collection of work---which is shared and discussed with children and parents over the year \citep{Rinaldi_2006_ReggioEmilia_BOOK,Giudici-Nicolosi_2014_Reggio-Approach}. 

The municipal school environment reflects a light-filled and open interior design, furnished with natural materials and a garden. Each site is equipped with an atelier, or dedicated studio laboratory used for creative instructional activities, and in-house kitchen used for daily meal preparation. Preschools and infant-toddler centers are open five full-time days per week from September through June \citep{Giudici-Nicolosi_2014_Reggio-Approach}. Extended day options are available by request at several municipal preschool locations throughout the school year, as is educational programming in July. Children with disabilities and single parents have been prioritized in admission criteria for infant-toddler and preschool programs since before it was decreed by 1971 state regulations \citep{Edwards-etal-eds_1998_Hundred-Languages}.

%The Reggio Emilia municipal infant-toddler model varies somewhat in that caregivers are assigned to infants and toddlers in single-year increments. Infant-toddler teachers generally have lower levels of initial training and receive less pay relative to preschool educators. Although the Reggio Emilia infant-toddler model does not include a full-time atelierista, caregivers receive training and support for lesson plans from municipal atelieristas \citep{Cagliari-etal-eds_2016_BOOK_Loris-Malaguzzi,Giudici-Nicolosi_2014_Reggio-Approach}. 

\subsection{Other Early Childhood Education Experiences}

Early childhood education programs in Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova differ in certain aspects of program administration, environmental features, and pedagogical methods. We discuss these differences below. 

%\subsubsection{State Preschools}

\subsubsection{Parma Municipal Schools}

Detailed documentation of the Parma municipal early childhood system is scarce. Conversation with the authors of \citet{Edwards-etal-eds_1998_Hundred-Languages} suggests that the pedagogical approach of Parma's municipal system is parallel to those of Reggio Emilia.\footnote{Kuperman, Interview with Carolyn Pope Edwards, 2016.} Parma's municipal system consolidated and expanded around 1975, about a decade after Reggio Emilia. Different administrations manage preschools and infant-toddler programs

As of 2001, Parma provided 16 infant-toddler centers throughout the municipality. Pedagogical coordinators perform both administrative and professional development roles. Assigned to a specific set of infant-toddler centers, these coordinators meet twice each month with all teachers collectively for shared reflection, on-site supervision, and to promote relationships with the families. The city director meets biweekly with all pedagogical coordinators for overall planning. University professors or administrators from other municipalities provide professional development in the form of continuing education \citep{Terzi-Cantarelli_2001_Parma}. Parma's infant-toddler centers are intentionally designed in the context of an apartment. \citet{Terzi-Cantarelli_2001_Parma} report mixed-age classes that include 18 total children from 13 months to 3 years in a single section, led by two teachers (9:1 child-teacher ratio). To accommodate parents, infant-toddler centers open at 7:30pm and offer three pick-up times: 2 p.m. (short-day), 3:30 p.m. (normal-day), or 5 p.m. (extended-day). Classrooms can be organized by single-age groups (e.g., 5-12 months, 12-24 months, and 24-36 months) or by mixed-age groups (e.g.,12-36 months) \citep{Majorano-etal_2009_CC-in-P}.

\subsubsection{Padova Municipal Schools}

Padova is located in the relatively more religious and politically diverse region of Veneto. Compared to Reggio Emilia and Parma, its municipal early childhood education system is smaller, offering 10 preschool centers. In contrast, Padova has a larger number of religious preschool centers. In 1989, the region of Veneto reported a total provision of childcare slots for 3.9\% of its infant-toddler population. In contrast, the region of Emilia Romagna reported a provision of infant-toddler childcare for 15.6\% of its population. The practice of professional development trainings for early childhood staff in Veneto first began in 1986 \citep{Becchi-Ferrari_1990_Pub-Inf-Centres-Italy}.

\subsubsection{Catholic Schools}

The Catholic Church offers the religious early childhood education. Prior to revised state policies in 1997-2000, Catholic preschools were taught by nuns, teacher training was not publicly mandated, and teacher-child ratios were relatively low. Coincidentally, religious programs began to hire trained, secular teachers who implemented varied curricula. In the north, traditional instruction began to incorporate some active-child learning, and some sites began to provide entry to children at age 24 months.

The Catholic Church is thus greatly concerned with equity and parity of state funding for its non-state schools. Unlike municipal systems, the majority of costs for private religious preschool are subsidized by tuition paid by enrolled families. Private schools historically were considered options only for affluent families that could afford the tuition expense \citep{Hohnerlein_2009_Paradox-Public-Preschools}. Prior to 2000, state funding for private schools reflected a 1947 constitutional clause that non-state schools could operate ``without financial burdens on the state.'' Today, depending on their income and the particular municipality's subsidy program, families enrolled in religious programs are eligible for subsidized tuition \citep{Hohnerlein_2009_Paradox-Public-Preschools}. In 2005, however, funding for state and private schools differed greatly. While equitable religious preschools could receive state funds, funding for religious primary schools (ages 6-11 years) was at 15.5\% the rate of public primary schools. Private secondary schools (ages 11-18 years) received no state funding \citep{Becchi-Ferrari_1990_Pub-Inf-Centres-Italy}.
