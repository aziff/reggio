We present the estimates of the methods described above for a handful of key outcomes.\footnote{We choose outcomes that are economically significant,  outcomes that have limited missing values, and outcomes with sufficient variation across individuals.}\footnote{A brief description on the outcomes is as follows: We rescale noncognitive outcomes, including SDQ score, Locus of Control, and Depression score, so that the higher value has a more socially positive meaning; \textbf{SDQ Composite - Child} is reported by mother, and \textbf{SDQ Composite} is self-reported; \textbf{IQ Score} is measured using Raven's Progressive Matrices; \textbf{How Much Child Likes School} has three scales, where 1 means ``A little", 2 means ``So so", and 3 means ``A lot";  \textbf{High School Grade} has the maximum scoring of 100, and since it is not a standardize measure, we standardize the high school grade for each city, cohort, and high school type based on our data; All the other measures reported in the estimation results are binary indicators. } In the child cohort, the Reggio Approach increased positive SDQ scores when compared to children who attended other preschools (OLS). This result gets more positive after controlling for more background characteristics. These results do not persist when comparing with children in Parma and Padova (DiD). Using PSM and AIPW to address issues of selection provides similar results as those of the OLS specification. The children are slightly more likely to be overweight and have worse health, although these estimates are not significant for all specifications. The other main outcomes do not show significant effects.

In the adolescent cohort, adolescents who attended the Reggio Approach are significantly less likely to be depressed according to OLS and AIPW results. However, DiD estimate with Parma shows that Reggio Approach individuals are more likely to be depressed compared to municipal preschool individuals in Parma. The Reggio Approach individuals are more likely to be obese than individuals who attended other types of preschool, and the estimate on obesity is consistent across most of the methods. Some methods show that Reggio Approach individuals are less likely to like school and less likely to be involved in sport activities, which is consistent with the increase in obesity. 

In the adult cohorts, there are differences when we compare Reggio Approach individuals to other preschool group and to no preschool group. The comparison with no preschool group shows many more statistically significant estimates. In the comparison with the other preschool group, the only outcome that shows some significance across different methods is high school graduation in the age-40 cohort. OLS estimate shows that the Reggio Approach age-40 individuals are more likely to graduate from high school than other group. 

In the comparison with no preschool group, Reggio Approach individuals in age-40 group are more likely to be employed. Moreover, Reggio Approach people are significantly more likely to work more hours than other groups for both the age-30 and age-40 groups. OLS estimates show that the Reggio Approach people are significantly more likely to be obese when compared to no preschool group in Reggio Emilia, which aligns with the adolescent results. The age-40 Reggio Approach individuals have significant and positive effects on locus of control, depression score, and voting behaviors.
