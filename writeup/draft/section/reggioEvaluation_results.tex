\subsubsection{Child Cohort}
Tables \ref{ols-CN-child-reg} to \ref{ols-B-child-reg} show OLS estimate on the participation of the Reggio Approach preschools for children in Reggio who attended Reggio Approach preschools or no preschool at all. We perform analysis using (i) no control, (ii) 6 controls selected by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and (iii) the full set of controls that include baseline variables available for the adult cohorts. 

All measures in Table \ref{ols-CN-child-reg} are converted so that higher value means more positive outcome. According to the results in the table, there is a significantly negative impact on the SDQ conduct scale. Children who attended the Reggio Approach schools have significantly higher conduct problem scale than children in Reggio who did not attend any preschools.

\subsubsection{Adult Cohort}
Tables \ref{ols-E-reg} to \ref{ols-S-reg} show OLS estimate on the participation of the Reggio Approach preschools for people in Reggio who attended Reggio Approach preschools or no preschool at all. We do not include the age-50 cohort in this analysis, as the Reggio Approach did not exist for that cohort. We perform analysis using (i) no control, (ii) 6 controls selected by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and (iii) the full set of controls that include baseline variables available for the adult cohorts.

Table \ref{ols-W-reg} shows consistently significant positive effects of the Reggio Approach on hours worked per week. Moreover, there are significant effects on the indicator for the lowest household income category for the age-40 cohort. Note that the measures for subject labor income, including ``Monthly Wage'' presented in the table, have very few observations. Household income suffers less from the missing value problem.

Table \ref{ols-H-reg} show that the significantly increasing effects of the Reggio Approach on numbers of days sick for the past month at the time of the interview for the age-30 cohort. Moreover, the results show the significant decreasing effects on whether the respondent has ever been suspended from school.

Table \ref{ols-N-reg} shows no consistently significant trends between the age-30 cohort and age-40 cohort. For the age-30 cohort, there are significantly decreasing effects on the optimistic look in life. Moreover, there are significantly increasing effects on whether the respondent is likely to do the same to someone who puts him/her in a difficult situation and to someone who insults him/her.

For the age-40 cohort, results show the significantly decreasing effects on depression for the age-30 cohort. There are also significantly positive effects on satisfaction with income and with work for the age-40 cohort. However, there are significantly positive effects on whether the respondent thinks work is source of stress.

Table \ref{ols-S-reg} shows consistently significant and negative effects of the Reggio Approach on whether the respondent does volunteer work for both the age-30 and age-40 cohorts. Moreover, for the age-40 cohort, there are significantly negative effects on respondents having migrant friends and significantly positive effects on whether respondents have ever voted for municipal and regional elections. For the age-30 cohort, there are significantly negative effects on whether respondents have ever voted for national elections.
