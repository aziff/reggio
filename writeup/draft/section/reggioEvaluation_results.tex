We present the estimates of the methods described above for a handful of key outcomes. See Appendix~\ref{sec:results} for estimates of more outcomes. In the child cohort, the Reggio Approach increased SDQ scores when compared to children who attended other preschools (OLS). This result gets more positive after controlling for more background characteristics. These results do not persist when comparing with children in Parma and Padova (difference-in-difference). Using AIPW to address issues of selection provides similar results as those of the OLS specification. The children are slightly more likely to be overweight and have worse health, although these estimates are not significant for all specifications. The results compared to no preschools are difficult to interpret for the child and adolescent cohorts considering few individuals in these cohorts stayed at home for preschool.

The effect of the Reggio Approach in the adolescent cohort is similar to that of the children cohort in that the subjects are more likely to be obese. This maintains across OLS specifications and the AIPW specification. Socially positive outcomes that are consistent include going to school, that is not dropping out of school, and decreased depression. However, the adolescents liked school less, especially when compared to their peers in Parma.

Adults in the age-40 cohort similarly showed lower levels of depression. For both adult cohorts, individuals worked more. This is one of the more consistent estimates, given it holds significance when comparing to those who attended no preschool and across both adult cohorts listed above. The adults are more likely to be employed, which is tied to this outcome of hours working.
