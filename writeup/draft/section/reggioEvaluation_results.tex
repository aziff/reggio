We present the estimates of the methods described above for a handful of key outcomes that do not have a severe missing value problem and have enough variation across individuals. For the children and adolescents cohorts, we only compare Reggio Approach people with people who went to other types of preschool, because there are less than 10 people in no preschool group for those cohorts. For adult cohorts, we compare Reggio Approach people with people who went to other types of preschool and people who did not attend any preschool, respectively.

In the child cohort, the Reggio Approach increased SDQ scores when compared to children who attended other preschools (OLS). This result gets more positive after controlling for more background characteristics. These results do not persist when comparing with children in Parma and Padova (difference-in-difference). Using AIPW to address issues of selection provides similar results as those of the OLS specification. The children are slightly more likely to be overweight and have worse health, although these estimates are not significant for all specifications. Other main outcomes do not show significant effect.

In the adolescent cohort, the Reggio Approach people are significantly less likely to be depressed according to OLS and AIPW results. However, DiD estimate with Parma shows that Reggio Approach people are more likely to be depressed compared to municipal preschool people in Parma. The Reggio Approach people are more likely to be obese than people who attended other types of preschool, and the estimate on obesity is consistent across most of the methods. Some methods show that Reggio Approach people are less likely to like school and less likely to be involved in sport activities. 

In the adult cohorts, there are differences when we compare Reggio Approach people to other preschool group and to no preschool group. The comparison with no preschool group shows much more statistically significant estimates. In the comparison with the other preschool group, the only outcome that shows some significance across different methods is high school graduation rate in age-40 cohort. OLS estimate shows that the Reggio Approach age-40 people are more likely to graduate from high school than other group. 

In the comparison with no preschool group, Reggio Approach people in age-40 group are more likely to be employed. Moreover, Reggio Approach people are significantly more likely to work more during the week than other groups for both age-30 and age-40 groups. OLS estimates show that the Reggio Approach people are significantly more likely to be obese when compared to no preschool group in Reggio. Age-40 Reggio Approach people have significant positive effects on locus of control, depression score, and voting behaviors.
