We present the estimates of the methods described above for a handful of key outcomes.\footnote{We choose outcomes that are economically significant,  outcomes that have limited missing values, and outcomes with sufficient variation across individuals. Results on more outcomes are reported in Appendix \ref{appsec:extended-outcome}. \textbf{[JJH: All outcomes. We need to summarize in text what we find in the appendix.]}}\footnote{A brief description of the outcomes is as follows: We rescale noncognitive outcomes, including SDQ (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) score, Locus of Control, and Depression score, so that the higher value has a more socially positive meaning; \textbf{SDQ Composite - Child} is reported by mother, and \textbf{SDQ Composite} is self-reported; \textbf{IQ Score} is measured using Raven's Progressive Matrices; \textbf{How Much Child Likes School} is a single question with three answers, where 1 means ``A little", 2 means ``So so", and 3 means ``A lot";  \textbf{High School Grade} has the maximum scoring of 100; since the mean and variance is not always the same, we standardize the high school grade for each city, cohort, and high school type based on our data to have mean zero and unit variance; All the other measures reported in the estimation results are binary indicators.} Overall, very few outcomes show statistically significant treatment effects that are robust across different estimation procedures for the Reggio Approach. The strongest results are shown when we compare the Reggio Approach with no preschool for the age-40 cohort. Accounting for multiple hypotheses testing using the step down procedure of \citet{Romano_Wolf_2005_E}, step down $p$-values are reported in appendix \ref{appsec:extended-outcome-sd}. We note that after the step down procedure is applied, there is a loss of statistical significance. The remainder of the paper focuses on non-step down results.

In the child cohort, as shown in Table \ref{ols-M-child-reg-pres}, the Reggio Approach increased the positive-SDQ (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) scores when compared to children who attended other preschools (OLS) \footnote{The SDQ is a widely-used scale inquiring about emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationships problems, and pro-social behavior \citep{Goodman_1997_JCPP}. For ease of interpretation, we have converted the SDQ score such that higher values correspond to more positive outcomes.}. This result becomes more positive after controlling for more background characteristics, or when comparing with children in Padova.\footnote{The estimated coefficient is still positive, but not statistically significant, when comparing with children in Parma (DiD).} Using PSM and AIPW to address issues of selection provides similar results as those of the OLS specification. The children are slightly more likely to be overweight and have worse health, although these estimates are not statistically significant for all specifications. The other main outcomes do not show significant effects.

In the adolescent cohort, shown in Table \ref{ols-M-adol-reg-pres}, adolescents who attended the Reggio Approach are significantly less likely to be depressed according to within Reggio Emilia analyses and DiD estimates with Parma and Padova. However, the propensity score matching with Parma and Padova adolescents do not show significant effect on depression. The Reggio Approach individuals are more likely to be obese than individuals who attended other types of preschool, and the estimate on obesity is consistent across most of the methods. Some methods show that Reggio Approach individuals are less likely to be involved in sport activities, which is consistent with the increase in obesity.

In the adult cohorts (age-40), there are differences when we compare Reggio Approach individuals to other preschool group and to no preschool group. The comparison with no preschool group, shown in tables \ref{ols-M-adult30-reg-nopres} and \ref{ols-M-adult40-reg-nopres}, shows many more statistically significant estimates. In the comparison with the other preschool group, shown in tables \ref{ols-M-adult30-reg-pres} and \ref{ols-M-adult40-reg-pres}, the only outcomes that shows some significance across different methods is high school graduation and voting behavior in the age-40 cohort. OLS estimate shows that the Reggio Approach age-40 individuals are more likely to graduate from high school than other groups within Reggio Emilia. Propensity score matching estimates show that the Reggio Approach age-40 individuals are more likely to have voted for regional election than people in Parma and Padova who attended preschool.

In the comparison with no preschool group, Reggio Approach individuals in age-40 group are more likely to be employed. Moreover, Reggio Approach people are significantly more likely to work more hours than other groups for both the age-30 and age-40 groups. OLS estimates show that the Reggio Approach people are significantly more likely to be obese when compared to no preschool group in Reggio Emilia, which aligns with the adolescent results. The age-40 Reggio Approach individuals have significant and positive effects on locus of control, the depression score, and voting behaviors across many methodologies.

We refer the reader to Appendix \ref{sec:results} for comparisons of the Reggio Approach with individual school types. We note that the estimated effects of the Reggio Approach on outcomes from these disaggregated comparisons vary depending on the comparison group being used as different school types exhibited different degrees of similarity to the Reggio Approach at different points of time (as evidenced by the results of our survey reported in Appendix \ref{sec:survey}). The disaggregated nature of these comparisons makes the results suitable to juxtaposition against the survey results that highlight differences in program components between the different types of schools. \textbf{[JJH: ? Summarize this mass of results please -- this is too vague.]}
