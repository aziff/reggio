\footnotesize\raggedright{Note: This table shows the estimates of the coefficient for attending Reggio Approach preschools from multiple methods. Column title indicates the corresponding control set and and model. ``NoneIt'' refers to the OLS estimate with no control variables. ``BICIt'' refers to the OLS estimate with controls selected by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and additional controls for caregiver's religion. ``FullIt'' refers to the OLS estimate with the full set of controls. ``DidPmIt'' refers to the difference-in-difference estimate of (Reggio Muni - Parma Muni) - (Reggio None - Parma None). ``DidPvIt'' refers to the difference-in-difference estimate of (Reggio Muni - Padova Muni) - (Reggio None - Padova None).  ``AIPWnoneIT" refers to AIPW estimate for comparing Reggio Approach children with children in Reggio who did not attend any preschool. ``AIPWpresIT" refers to AIPW estimate for comparing Reggio Approach children with children in Reggio who attended other type of preschool. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. Bold number shows that the estimate is statistically significant at the 15\% level.

Column title indicates the corresponding control set and and model. For age-30 cohort, the columns are as follows: ``None30'' refers to the OLS estimate with no control variables. ``BIC30'' refers to the OLS estimate with controls selected by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and additional controls for caregiver's religion. ``Full30'' refers to the OLS estimate with the full set of controls. ``DidPm30'' refers to the difference-in-difference estimate of (Reggio Muni - Parma Muni) - (Reggio None - Parma None). ``DidPv30'' refers to the difference-in-difference estimate of (Reggio Muni - Padova Muni) - (Reggio None - Padova None).  ``AIPWnone30" refers to AIPW estimate for comparing Reggio Approach children with children in Reggio who did not attend any preschool. ``AIPWpres30" refers to AIPW estimate for comparing Reggio Approach children with children in Reggio who attended other type of preschool. Column titles are analogous for age-40 cohort. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. Bold number shows that the estimate is statistically significant at the 15\% level.
