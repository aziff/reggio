  Abstract                 = {This paper estimates the effects of maternal malnutrition exploiting the 1959--1961 Chinese famine as a natural experiment. In the 1% sample of the 2000 Chinese Census, we find that fetal exposure to acute maternal malnutrition had compromised a range of socioeconomic outcomes, including: literacy, labor market status, wealth and marriage market outcomes. Women married spouses with less education and later, as did men, if at all. In addition, maternal malnutrition reduced the sex ratio (males to females) in two generations---those prenatally exposed and their children---presumably through heightened male mortality. This tendency toward female offspring is interpretable in light of the Trivers-Willard (1973) hypothesis, according to which parents in poor condition should skew the offspring sex ratio toward daughters. Hong Kong natality micro data from 1984--2004 further confirm this pattern of female offspring among mainland-born residents exposed to malnutrition in utero.},

  Abstract                 = {Between 1984 and 2001, the share of nonelderly adults receiving Social Security Disability Insurance income (DI) rose by 60 percent to 5.3 million beneficiaries. Rapid program growth despite improving aggregate health appears to be explained by reduced screening stringency, declining demand for less skilled workers, and an unforeseen increase in the earnings replacement rate. We estimate that the sum of these forces doubled the labor force exit propensity of displaced high school dropouts after 1984, lowering measured U.S. unemployment by one-half a percentage point. Steady state calculations augur a further 40 percent increase in the rate of DI receipt.},

An analysis of aggregate changes in the relative supplies and wages of workers by education from 1940 to 1996 indicates strong and persistent growth in relative demand favoring college graduates. Rapid skill upgrading within detailed industries accounts for most of the growth in the relative demand for college workers, particularly since 1970. Analyses of four data sets indicate that the rate of skill upgrading has been greater in more computer-intensive industries.},

Hypotheses focus on the role of parents' attitudes as a mechanism linking parents' behavior to their children's attitudes. We test these hypotheses using intergenerational panel data that include measures of parents' attitudes taken directly from parents and measures of children's attitudes taken directly from children. Results demonstrate strong effects of parental divorce, remarriage, and widowhood on children's attitudes toward premarital sex, cohabitation, marriage, childbearing, and divorce. The results also show that parents' own attitudes link their behavior to their children's attitudes, although substantial effects of parental behavior remain after controlling for parents' attitudes.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyze the value placed by rational agents on self-confidence, and the strategies employed in its pursuit. Confidence in one's abilities generally enhances motivation, making it a valuable asset for individuals with imperfect willpower. This demand for self-serving beliefs (which can also arise from hedonic or signaling motives) must be weighed against the risks of overconfidence. On the supply side, we develop a model of self-deception through endogenous memory that reconciles the motivated and rational features of human cognition. The resulting intrapersonal game of strategic communication typically leads to multiple equilibria. While "positive thinking" can improve welfare, it can also be self-defeating (and nonetheless pursued).},

  Abstract                 = {To revise 1998 recommendations on childhood obesity, an Expert Committee, comprised of representatives from 15 professional organizations, appointed experienced scientists and clinicians to 3 writing groups to review the literature and recommend approaches to prevention, assessment, and treatment. Because effective strategies remain poorly defined, the writing groups used both available evidence and expert opinion to develop the recommendations. Primary care providers should universally assess children for obesity risk to improve early identification of elevated BMI, medical risks, and unhealthy eating and physical activity habits. Providers can provide obesity prevention messages for most children and suggest weight control interventions for those with excess weight. The writing groups also recommend changing office systems so that they support efforts to address the problem. BMI should be calculated and plotted at least annually, and the classification should be integrated with other information such as growth pattern, familial obesity, and medical risks to assess the child';s obesity risk. For prevention, the recommendations include both specific eating and physical activity behaviors, which are likely to promote maintenance of healthy weight, but also the use of patient-centered counseling techniques such as motivational interviewing, which helps families identify their own motivation for making change. For assessment, the recommendations include methods to screen for current medical conditions and for future risks, and methods to assess diet and physical activity behaviors. For treatment, the recommendations propose 4 stages of obesity care; the first is brief counseling that can be delivered in a health care office, and subsequent stages require more time and resources. The appropriateness of higher stages is influenced by a patient's age and degree of excess weight. These recommendations recognize the importance of social and environmental change to reduce the obesity epidemic but also identify ways healthcare providers and health care systems can be part of broader efforts.},

  Abstract                 = {This article reviews the existing literature on the economic and other benefits of attending community college. First, the article reports on the earnings gains across all students and reviews the evidence for subgroups by gender, minority status, and credits accumulated. The article then reviews the methodological challenges associated with calculating earnings gains from attending a community college. Despite these challenges, the evidence for the significant earnings gains from community college attendance appears to be compelling. The second part of the article reviews the literature on a broader spectrum of gains, such as health, crime, and welfare reliance. This literature is very limited and potentially offers an important area for further research to establish the full returns from community college attendance.},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of group size, staff-child ratio, training, and other characteristics of child care on child development is estimated using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. In contrast to most previous research, the sample is large and nationally representative, the data contain good measures of the home environment, and there are repeated measures of child development. Child care characteristics have little association with child development on average. Associations are found for some groups of children, but they are as likely to be of the "wrong" sign as they are to be of the sign predicted by developmental psychologists.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides new estimates of the medium and long-term impacts of Head Start on the health and behavioral problems of its participants. We identify these impacts using discontinuities in the probability of participation induced by program eligibility rules. Our strategy allows us to identify the effect of Head Start for the set of individuals in the neighborhoods of multiple discontinuities, which vary with family size, state and year (as opposed to a smaller set of individuals neighboring a single discontinuity). Participation in the program reduces the incidence of behavioral problems, serious health problems and obesity of male children at ages 12 and 13. It also lowers depression and obesity among adolescents, and reduces engagement in criminal activities for young adults.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we document the ways in which parental behavior and socioeconomic status affect children's health. We examine parental behavior in both the prenatal period and childhood. We present evidence on the correlation of this behavior with income and parents' socioeconomic status, and on the ways in which parents' actions affect children's health. We conclude that while health insurance coverage and advances in medical treatment may be important determinants of children's health, they cannot be the only pillars: Protecting children's health also calls for a broader set of policies that target parents' health-related behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop inference procedures for policy analysis based on regression methods. We consider policy interventions that correspond to either changes in the distribution of covariates, or changes in the conditional distribution of the outcome given covariates, or both. Under either of these policy scenarios, we derive functional central limit theorems for regression-based estimators of the status quo and counterfactual marginal distributions. This result allows us to construct simultaneous confidence sets for function-valued policy effects, including the effects on the marginal distribution function, quantile function, and other related functionals. We use these confidence sets to test functional hypotheses such as no-effect, positive effect, or stochastic dominance. Our theory applies to general policy interventions and covers the main regression methods including classical, quantile, duration, and distribution regressions. We illustrate the results with an empirical application on wage decompositions using data for the United States. Of independent interest is the use of distribution regression as a tool for modeling the entire conditional distribution, encompassing duration/transformation regression, and representing an alternative to quantile regression.}

We pay particular attention to the type of family structure that resident fathers and children share, and we find this to have an influence on both the activities that fathers engage in with their children and on children's grades. Both family structure and shared activities between fathers and their children are associated with children's academic achievement, but father's time does not appear to mediate the effects of family structure on children's grades.},

Head Start is associated with large and significant gains in test scores among both whites and African-Americans. However, among African-Americans, these gains are quickly lost. Head Start significantly reduces the probability that a white child will repeat a grade but it has no effect on grade repetition among African-American children. Both whites and African-Americans who attend Head Start, or other preschools, gain greater access to preventive health services. Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a large and persistent association between education and health. In this paper, we review what is known about this link. We first document the facts about the relationship between education and health. The education %u2018gradient%u2019 is found for both health behaviors and health status, though the former does not fully explain the latter. The effect of education increases with increasing years of education, with no evidence of a sheepskin effect. Nor are there differences between blacks and whites, or men and women. Gradients in behavior are biggest at young ages, and decline after age 50 or 60. We then consider differing reasons why education might be related to health. The obvious economic explanations %u2013 education is related to income or occupational choice %u2013 explain only a part of the education effect. We suggest that increasing levels of education lead to different thinking and decision-making patterns. The monetary value of the return to education in terms of health is perhaps half of the return to education on earnings, so policies that impact educational attainment could have a large effect on population health.},

  Abstract                 = {Although recent evidence suggests that non-cognitive skills such as engagement matter for academic and economic success, there is little evidence on how key educational inputs affect the development of these skills. We present a re-analysis of follow-up data from the Project STAR class-size experiment and find evidence that early-grade class-size reductions did improve subsequent student initiative. However, these effects did not persist into the 8th grade. Furthermore, the external and, possibly, the internal validity of these inferences is compromised by non-random attrition. We also present a complementary analysis based on nationally representative survey data and a research design that relies on contemporaneous within-student and within-teacher comparisons across two academic subjects. Our results indicate that smaller classes in 8th grade lead to improvements in measures of student engagement with effect sizes ranging from 0.05 to 0.09 and smaller effects persisting two years later. Using the estimated earnings impact of these non-cognitive skills and the direct cost of a class-size reduction, the implied internal rate of return from an 8th-grade class-size reduction is 4.6 percent overall, but 7.9 percent in urban schools.},

  Abstract                 = {{CONTEXT}: {H}ome visitation to families with young children has been promoted as an effective way to prevent child maltreatment, but few studies have examined the conditions under which such programs meet this goal. {OBJECTIVE}: {T}o investigate whether the presence of domestic violence limits the effects of nurse home visitation interventions in reducing substantiated reports of child abuse and neglect. {DESIGN}: {F}ifteen-year follow-up study of a randomized trial. {SETTING}: {S}emirural community in upstate {N}ew {Y}ork. {PARTICIPANTS}: {O}f 400 socially disadvantaged pregnant women with no previous live births enrolled consecutively between {A}pril 1978 and {S}eptember 1980, 324 mothers and their children participated in the follow-up study. {INTERVENTIONS}: {F}amilies were randomly assigned to receive routine perinatal care (control group; n = 184 participated in follow-up), routine care plus nurse home visits during pregnancy only (n = 100), or routine care plus nurse home visits during pregnancy and through the child's second birthday (n = 116). {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: {N}umber of substantiated reports over the entire 15-year period involving the study child as subject regardless of the identity of the perpetrator or involving the mother as perpetrator regardless of the identity of the child abstracted from state records and analyzed by treatment group and level of domestic violence in the home as measured by the {C}onflict {T}actics {S}cale. {RESULTS}: {F}amilies receiving home visitation during pregnancy and infancy had significantly fewer child maltreatment reports involving the mother as perpetrator ({P} =. 01) or the study child as subject ({P} =.04) than families not receiving home visitation. {T}he number of maltreatment reports for mothers who received home visitation during pregnancy only was not different from the control group. {F}or mothers who received visits through the child's second birthday, the treatment effect decreased as the level of domestic violence increased. {O}f women who reported 28 or fewer incidents of domestic violence (79% of sample), home-visited mothers had significantly fewer child maltreatment reports during the 15-year period than mothers not receiving the longer-term intervention ({P} =.01). {H}owever, this intervention did not significantly reduce child maltreatment among mothers reporting more than 28 incidents of domestic violence (21% of sample). {CONCLUSIONS}: {T}he presence of domestic violence may limit the effectiveness of interventions to reduce incidence of child abuse and neglect. {JAMA}. 2000;284:1385--1391.},

  Abstract                 = {Ninety-four Spanish-speaking preschoolers (M age = 54.51 months, SD = 4.72; 43 girls) were randomly assigned to receive the High/Scope Curriculum (control n = 32) or the Literacy Express Preschool Curriculum in English-only (n = 31) or initially in Spanish transitioning to English (n = 31). Children's emergent literacy skills were assessed before and after the intervention in Spanish and English. Children in the English-only and transitional groups made significant gains in their emergent literacy skills in both Spanish and English compared to the control group, The English-only and transitional models were equally effective for English language outcomes, but for Spanish-language outcomes, only the transitional model was effective. The results suggest that a targeted early literacy intervention can improve Spanish-speaking preschoolers' preliteracy skills.},

  Abstract                 = {Gradients across socio-economic position exist for many measures of children's health and development in higher-income countries. These associations may not be consistent, however, among the millions of children living in lower- and middle-income countries. Our objective was to examine child development and growth in young children across socio-economic position in four developing countries. We used cross-sectional surveys, child development assessments, measures of length (LAZ), and home stimulation (Family Care Index) of children in India, Indonesia, Peru, and Senegal. The Extended Ages and Stages Questionnaire (EASQ) was administered to parents of all children ages 3--23 mo in the household (n =8,727), and length measurements were taken for all children 0--23 mo (n = 11,102). Household wealth and maternal education contributed significantly and independently to the variance in EASQ and LAZ scores in all countries, while controlling for child's age and sex, mother's age and marital status, and household size. Being in the fifth wealth quintile in comparison with the first quintile was associated with significantly higher EASQ scores (0.27 to 0.48 of a standardized score) and higher LAZ scores (0.37 to 0.65 of a standardized score) in each country, while controlling for maternal education and covariates. Wealth and education gradients increased over the first two years in most countries for both EASQ and LAZ scores, with larger gradients seen in 16--23-mo-olds than in 0--7mo-olds. Mediation analyses revealed that parental home stimulation activities and LAZ were significant mediating variables and explained up to 50% of the wealth effects on the EASQ.},

  Abstract                 = {Physical activity is associated with various health-relevant psychosocial and physiological processes, but activity stability across extended time periods is inadequately understood. This lifespan longitudinal cohort study examined activity levels of 723 males and 554 females. Associations across time were computed and structural equation modeling compared a one factor model and a simplex model. Results showed activity levels are somewhat stable from childhood through middle and late adulthood. Further, a simplex model provided a better fit than a one factor model. Successful models and interventions to improve health will likely require a more nuanced, pattern-sensitive understanding of physical activity across time.

  Abstract                 = {Mobility and flexibility is increasingly demanded as structural change challenges estab-lished educational systems and traditional occupational demarcations. We use Lazear?s skill-weights approach (2003) first to operationalize the degree of specificity of skill com-binations in an innovative manner and second to derive hypotheses about the effects of occupation-specific skill combinations. In our empirical section, we find that the more specific an occupation, the smaller is the probability of an occupational change, as ex-pected. Furthermore, we are able to identify different clusters of occupations that are char-acterized by similar skill combinations within a given cluster and different skill combina-tions between clusters. We find that employees in very specific occupations have a com-paratively higher probability of changing their occupation within than between skill clus-ters. Moreover, occupational mobility within a skill cluster is accompanied by wage gains, while mobility between skill clusters results in wage losses. Not surprisingly, the more specific the former occupation is, either the higher is the resulting wage loss or the smaller is the resulting wage gain depending on whether the move is between or within skill clus-ters, respectively. Therefore, the acquired skill combination rather than the occupation per se crucially determines the mobility of an employee.},

  Abstract                 = {Do recent declines in first marriage rates signal that an increasing proportion of women will remain single their entire lives, or merely that they are postponing marriage to older ages? Our forecasts for cohorts born in the 1950s and 1960s suggest that marriage will remain nearly universal for American women-close to 90 percent of women are predicted to marry. However, separate forecasts by educational attainment reveal a new socioeconomic pattern of first marriage: Whereas in the past, women with more education were less likely to marry, recent college graduates are now forecast to marry at higher levels despite their later entry into first marriage. This educational crossover, which occurs for both black women and white women in recent cohorts, suggests that marriage is increasingly becoming a province of the most educated, a trend that may become a new source of inequality for future generations. Forecasts presented here use data from the 1995 Current Population Survey and compare estimates from the Hernes model with those from the Coale-McNeil model.},

  Abstract                 = {Since the mid-1990s, three states, including Oklahoma, have established a universal pre-kindergarten (pre-K) program. We analyze the effects of Oklahoma�s universal pre-kindergarten (pre-K) program for four-year-olds on children in Tulsa Public Schools (TPS). The main difficulty with testing the causal impact of a voluntary pre-K program is that certain parents are more likely to select pre-K, and these parents might have other unobservable characteristics that influence the test outcomes of their children. Because TPS administered an identical test in September 2001 to children just beginning pre-K and children just beginning kindergarten, we can compare test outcomes of �old� pre-kindergarten students to test outcomes of �young� kindergarten students who attended pre-K the previous year. We find that the Tulsa pre-K program increases cognitive/knowledge scores by approximately 0.39 standard deviation, motor skills scores by approximately 0.24 standard deviation, and language scores by approximately 0.38 standard deviation. Impacts tend to be largest for Hispanics, followed by blacks, with little impact for whites. Children who qualify for a free lunch have larger impacts than other children.},

  Abstract                 = {The development of 16 children who were hospitalized for severe malnutrition and participated in a home-visiting program of psychosocial stimulation was compared with that of two other groups who were also hospitalized but received standard medical care only: severely malnourished group (n = 18) and an adequately nourished one (n = 20). All groups were assessed regularly on the Griffiths Mental Development Scales and the Stanford-Binet test. Both groups of malnourished children were markedly behind the adequately nourished group on admission to the hospital and the group that received no intervention showed little sign of catching up. The intervention group caught up to the adequately nourished group in 2 years. This report covers the third year of home-visiting and the 3 years following its cessation. The intervention group showed a decline in three of the five Griffiths subscales. However, they retained a marked advantage over the nonintervention group of malnourished children on the Stanford-Binet test until the end of follow-up, showing no further decline in the last year. For height, both malnourished groups failed to catch up to the adequately nourished group. It was concluded that a relatively simple intervention can benefit the development of severely malnourished children.},

  Abstract                 = {Most states in the U.S. allow for unilateral divorce, which increases the ease of divorce by not requiring the explicit consent of both partners. Such regulations have come under fire for their perceived negative consequences for marital stability and resulting child outcomes, but there is no evidence to date to support the contention that easier divorce regulations are actually bad for children. I assess the long run implications for children of growing up in a unilateral divorce environment, by measuring how such youth exposure affects adult outcomes. Using 40 years of census data to exploit the variation across states and over time in changes in divorce regulation, I confirm that unilateral divorce regulations do significantly increase the incidence of divorce. I also find that adults who were exposed to unilateral divorce regulations as children are less well educated and have lower family incomes. They are also more likely themselves to be both married and separated, and both of these effects appear to reflect primarily a shift towards earlier marriage and separation. Women in these exposed cohorts are less attached to the labor force, while men are somewhat more attached; the timing of these effects appears consistent with a causal role for marriage. Thus, exposure to easier divorce regulation as a youth appears to worsen adult outcomes along a number of dimensions, but the ultimate implications depend on the long run impacts of earlier family formation among this cohort.},

  Abstract                 = {Two guidelines for nonparametric bootstrap hypothesis testing are highlighted. The first recommends that resampling be done in a way that reflects the null hypothesis, even when the true hypothesis is distant from the null. The second guideline argues that bootstrap hypothesis tests should employ methods that are already recognized as having good features in the closely related problem of confidence interval construction. Violation of the first guideline can seriously reduce the power of a test. Sometimes this reduction is spectacular, since it is most serious when the null hypothesis is grossly in error. The second guideline is of some importance when the conclusion of a test is equivocal. It has no direct bearing on power, but improves the level accuracy of a test.},

  Abstract                 = {This article uses data from the National Survey of Families and Households to examine whether parental conflict prior to divorce can explain why children with divorced parents exhibit more academic and adjustment difficulties than children with parents who stay together. Children whose parents divorce are exposed to more conflict and acrimony than children who grow up in stable marriages, and this may explain why the former do less well than the latter. The results indicate that parental conflict is partly but by no means completely responsible for the association between divorce and child welfare. The results also suggest that, for four of the sixteen measures of child well-being examined, children exposed to high levels of parental conflict are neither better off nor worse off, on average, when their parents divorce, while those exposed to low levels of parental conflict appear to suffer severe disadvantages when their parents separate. This suggests that, in some areas, marital relations prior to divorce help determine when the consequences of divorce are particularly harmful for children and when the consequences of divorce are relatively benign.},

  Abstract                 = {This study examines the effects of family structure on child misbehavior, paying close attention to the complexity and endogeneity of family structure. We use longitudinal measures of childhood family structure to capture its complexity and fixed-effects models to control for the unobserved, time-invariant family and child characteristics, which contribute to the endogeneity of family structure. Our results suggest that, other things being equal, stability of intact, step-, and single-mother families is beneficial in lowering the risk of misbehavior, with a weaker effect for single-mother families. This finding challenges the consensus about a detrimental effect of alternative family structures and the incomplete institution thesis regarding step-families. Our analysis also provides two methodological findings: (1) duration of different types of current family structure is superior to other longitudinal measures, which, in turn, are superior to snapshot measures of family structure, and (2) conventional OLS models tend to produce downward bias for the effects of family structure on child misbehavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Methods of estimation of regression coefficients are proposed when the regression function includes a polynomial in a "true" regressor which is measured with error. Two sources of additional information concerning the unobservable regressor are considered: either an additional indicator of the regressor (itself measured with error) or instrumental variables that characterize the systematic variation in the true regressor. In both cases, estimators are constructed by relating moments involving the unobserved variables to moments of observables; these relations lead to recursion formulae for computation of the regression coefficients and nuisance parameters (e.g., moments of the measurement error). Consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimated coefficients is demonstrated, and consistent estimators of the asymptotic covariant matrices are provided. Coauthors are Whitney K. Newey, Hidehiko Ichimura, and James L. Powell.},

  Abstract                 = {The most common solution to the errors in variables problem for the linear regression model is the use of instrumental variable estimation. However, this methodology cannot be applied in the nonlinear regression framework. In this paper we develop consistent estimators for nonlinear regression specifications when errors in variables are present. We apply our methodology to estimation of Engel curves on household data. First, we find that the 'Lesser-Working' specification of budget shares regressed on the log of income or expenditure should be generalized to higher-order terms in log income. Also, we find that errors in variables in either reported income or expenditure should be accounted for. Lastly, and perhaps most interesting, we find rather strong support for the Gorman rank restriction on the matrix of coefficients for the polynomial terms in income.},

  Abstract                 = {{E}pidemiologic studies indicate that children exposed to early adverse experiences are at increased risk for the development of depression, anxiety disorders, or both. {P}ersistent sensitization of central nervous system ({CNS}) circuits as a consequence of early life stress, which are integrally involved in the regulation of stress and emotion, may represent the underlying biological substrate of an increased vulnerability to subsequent stress as well as to the development of depression and anxiety. {A} number of preclinical studies suggest that early life stress induces long-lived hyper(re)activity of corticotropin-releasing factor ({CRF}) systems as well as alterations in other neurotransmitter systems, resulting in increased stress responsiveness. {M}any of the findings from these preclinical studies are comparable to findings in adult patients with mood and anxiety disorders. {E}merging evidence from clinical studies suggests that exposure to early life stress is associated with neurobiological changes in children and adults, which may underlie the increased risk of psychopathology. {C}urrent research is focused on strategies to prevent or reverse the detrimental effects of early life stress on the {CNS}. {T}he identification of the neurobiological substrates of early adverse experience is of paramount importance for the development of novel treatments for children, adolescents, and adults.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates the factors underlying cognitive achievement among young children using a Becker-Tomes model of intergenerational transmission adapted to incorporate transmission of a family's cultural orientation toward achievement. The model relates a child's achievement to parental income and cognitive skills as well as to grandparent's income and education. Using data on PPVT scores for children born to women in the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth, we find large and significant positive effects of the mother's AFQT score, her schooling, and the grandparents' schooling. We also find that increases in the mother's hours at work bear significant negative effects on her child's achievement. This effect is only partially compensated for by higher money income among these young children. A mother's welfare dependence is associated with a reduction in her child's PPVT score, an effect that is not explained by poverty persistence. Evidence that welfare participation signals transmission of low achievement orientation while variables such as maternal education signal positive values is reinforced through the use of a mediating variable measuring the time a mother spends reading to her children.},

  Abstract                 = {{CONTEXT}: {A} home visitation program using nurses to improve maternal and child outcomes had favorable results in a randomized trial with a primarily white, semirural population. {M}any of the short-term findings have been replicated with urban blacks, but whether the program will continue to demonstrate effectiveness after its conclusion is uncertain. {OBJECTIVE}: {T}o determine the effectiveness of a prenatal and infancy home visitation program on the maternal life course of women in an urban environment 3 years after the program ended. {DESIGN} {AND} {SETTING}: {T}hree-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial of women seen consecutively between {J}une 1990 and {A}ugust 1991 at an obstetrical clinic in {M}emphis, {T}enn, who were enrolled in a visitation program for 2 years after the birth of their first child. {PARTICIPANTS}: {A} cohort of 743 women who were primarily black, were pregnant for less than 29 weeks, had no previous live births, and had at least 2 sociodemographic risk factors (unmarried, <12 years of education, or unemployed). {INTERVENTION}: {A}n average of 7 (range, 0--18) home visits during pregnancy and 26 (range, 0--71) from birth to the child's second birthday. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: {R}ate of subsequent pregnancy, mean interval between first and second birth, and mean number of months of welfare use. {RESULTS}: {C}ompared with the control group, women who received home visits by nurses had fewer subsequent pregnancies (1.15 vs 1.34; {P}=.03), fewer closely spaced subsequent pregnancies (0.22 vs 0.32; {P}=.03), longer intervals between the birth of the first and second child (30.25 vs 26.60 months; {P}=.004), and fewer months of using {A}id to {F}amilies with {D}ependent {C}hildren (32.55 vs 36.19; {P}=.01) and food stamps (41.57 vs 45.04; {P}=.005). {C}ompared with the effect of the program while the program was in operation, the effect after it ended was essentially equal for {A}id to {F}amilies with {D}ependent {C}hildren, greater for food stamps, greater for rates of closely spaced subsequent pregnancies, and smaller for rates of subsequent pregnancy overall. {CONCLUSIONS}: {W}e found enduring effects of a home visitation program on the lives of black women living in an urban setting. {W}hile these results were smaller in magnitude than those achieved in a previous trial with white women living in a semirural setting, the direction of the effects was consistent across the 2 studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Past research suggests that increasing the incomes of single mothers will bring integenerational benefits. However, some sources of income may be more beneficial to children than others. This paper evaluates the effects of child support payments from absent fathers on children's achievement test scores and home environments, using three methods to control for heterogeneity among families. The results provide evidence that increased child support payments may improve the academic achievement of elementary school-age children even more than income from other sources. While overall family income appears to affect levels of cognitive stimulation available in children's homes, child support does not have larger effects than other sources of income. These findings suggest that increasing the financial contributions of absent fathers through improved child support enforcement or other interventions may be a particularly beneficial income support strategy for children in single mother families.},

  Abstract                 = {{S}ome rhesus monkey ({M}acaca mulatta) infants have a "despair" or depression-like response to mother-infant separation, while others do not. {T}he presumed interrelation between early rearing conditions and the neurobiological status of the infant that might lead to increased risk for despair is not understood. {I}n this study, the characteristics of the "mother" were controlled by rearing infant rhesus monkeys with their biological mothers, or with inanimate mothers. {B}ehavioral data were collected before and after separation at 6--7 months of age. {T}he neurobiological status of the infants was evaluated by measuring the concentration of norepinephrine, its major metabolite, and the metabolites of dopamine and serotonin in cerebrospinal fluid. {T}he results suggest that despair is not simply a behavioral response to separation. {I}nstead, despair may reflect the inability to cope with the separation environment. {C}oping with the separation environment appears to depend on neurobiological and behavioral characteristics of the infant that are related to, if not determined by, characteristics of the mother.},

  Abstract                 = {{H}ow do movements in the distribution of income and wealth affect the macroeconomy? {T}he authors analyze this question using a calibrated version of the stochastic growth model with partially uninsurable idiosyncratic risk and movements in aggregate productivity. {I}n the stationary stochastic equilibrium, the behavior of the macroeconomic aggregates can be almost perfectly described using only the mean of the wealth distribution. {T}his result is robust to substantial changes in both parameter values and model specification. {T}heir benchmark model displays far less cross-sectional dispersion and skewness in wealth than {U}.{S}. data. {H}owever, an extension does succeed in replicating the key features of the wealth data.},

  Abstract                 = {For two types of non-parametric hypotheses optimum tests are derived against certain classes of alternatives. The two kinds of hypotheses are related and may be illustrated by the following example: (1) The joint distribution of the variables $X_1, \cdots, X_m, Y_1, \cdots, Y_n$ is invariant under all permutations of the variables; (2) the variables are independently and identically distributed. It is shown that the theory of optimum tests for hypotheses of the first kind is the same as that of optimum similar tests for hypotheses of the second kind. Most powerful tests are obtained against arbitrary simple alternatives, and in a number of important cases most stringent tests are derived against certain composite alternatives. For the example (1), if the distributions are restricted to probability densities, Pitman's test based on $\bar y - \bar x$ is most powerful against the alternatives that the $X$'s and $Y$'s are independently normally distributed with common variance, and that $E(X_i) = \xi, E(Y_i) = \eta$ where $\eta > \xi$. If $\eta - \xi$ may be positive or negative the test based on $|\bar y - \bar x|$ is most stringent. The definitions are sufficiently general that the theory applies to both continuous and discrete problems, and that tied observations present no difficulties. It is shown that continuous and discrete problems may be combined. Pitman's test for example, when applied to certain discrete problems, coincides with Fisher's exact test, and when $m = n$ the test based on $|\bar y - \bar x|$ is most stringent for hypothesis (1) against a broad class of alternatives which includes both discrete and absolutely continuous distributions.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers the consistent estimation of nonlinear errors-in-variables models. It adopts the functional modeling approach by assuming that the true but unobserved regressors are random variables but making no parametric assumption on the distribution from which the latent variables are drawn. This paper shows how the information extracted from the replicate measurements can be used to identify and consistently estimate a general nonlinear errors-in-variables model. The identification is established through characteristic functions. The estimation procedure involves nonparametric estimation of the conditional density of the latent variables given the measurements using the identification results at the first stage, and at the second stage, a semiparametric nonlinear least-squares estimator is proposed. The consistency of the proposed estimator is also established. Finite sample performance of the estimator is investigated through a Monte Carlo study.},

  Abstract                 = {{I}n this paper we provide new and convincing evidence on the presence and magnitude of feedback effects associated with 'make work pay' policies currently under consideration in the {US}, {C}anada, the {UK} and other developed countries. {W}e build a general equilibrium model of the labor market and use the model to study the effects of policies currently implemented in practice only as small-scale social experiments. {T}he evidence from our model experiments is particularly compelling as we first test the partial equilibrium implications of our model using experimental data: in particular, we calibrate the model to the control group in a randomized experiment and find the model predicts the program group outcomes and the experimental impact estimates very well. {W}e then use the model to quantify the effects of the experimental program introduced in general equilibrium. {W}e apply our methodology to the evaluation of the {C}anadian {S}elf-{S}ufficiency {P}roject ({SSP}), a policy providing generous financial incentives for {I}ncome {A}ssistance ({IA}) recipients to obtain stable employment. {O}ur results reveal several important feedback effects associated with the {SSP} policy; taken together, these feedback effects reverse the cost-benefit conclusions implied by the partial equilibrium experimental evaluation. {T}he substantial general equilibrium effects reported here are illustrative of the feedback effects that are likely to arise in a broad range of other programs that seek to 'make work pay' through the subsidization of search and work.},

  Abstract                 = {Three different preschool models operating in an urban school district were identified through cluster analysis of teacher responses to the Pre-K Survey of Beliefs and Practices. The language, self-help, social, motor, and adaptive development, along with mastery of basic skills, of 721 4-year-olds randomly selected from these models were compared. Children in the child-initiated model demonstrated greater mastery of basic skills than did children in programs in which academics were emphasized and skills were taught. Children in the combination model did significantly poorer on all measures except self-help and development of social coping skills compared with children in either the child-initiated or academically directed models. Girls outperformed boys in all areas except gross motor development and play and leisure skills. Implications for educational policymakers are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {This study examined development of academic, language, and social skills among 4-year-olds in publicly supported prekindergarten (pre-K) programs in relation to 3 methods of measuring pre-K quality, which are as follows: (a) adherence to 9 standards of quality related to program infrastructure and design, (b) observations of the overall quality of classroom environments, and (c) observations of teachers' emotional and instructional interactions with children in classrooms. Participants were 2,439 children enrolled in 671 pre-K classrooms in 11 states. Adjusting for prior skill levels, child and family characteristics, program characteristics, and state, teachers' instructional interactions predicted academic and language skills and teachers' emotional interactions predicted teacher-reported social skills. Findings suggest that policies, program development, and professional development efforts that improve teacher-child interactions can facilitate children's school readiness.},

  Abstract                 = {The Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study was founded in 1935 with the double purpose of preventing delin quency and providing research in the area of delinquency pre vention. 325 boys were selected to receive preventive treat ment, and a carefully matched group of 325 boys were provided as a control group. The treatment program utilized many of the practices prevalent in welfare work: family guidance, medical and academic assistance, co-ordination of community agencies, and supplementary entertainment for the boys. This article traces into adulthood the lives of 253 of the "treat ment" boys and their 253 matched mates in the control group. Although the boys were counseled for an average of five years, whatever benefits they may have received were not reflected in their criminal rates: As many treated boys as control boys had been convicted of crimes; they had com mitted approximately equal numbers of crimes and did not differ significantly in the ages when such crimes were com mitted. Nevertheless, evidence gleaned from this program suggests that early treatment and intensive contact with the boy may be an effective means toward crime prevention.},

  Abstract                 = {This investigation uses data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to identify the pattern of aggression by sex and race among young black and white children and uses hierarchical linear models to explore whether child gender moderates the influences of neighborhood characteristics, familystructure or parenting practices on aggression. Two key findings emerge. First, at ages 3 and 5, black boys are more aggressive than their peers. Second, child gender moderates a number of influences on aggression. Among blacks, having a biological or social father move into the household by age 3 and mothers' victimization by violence associate with higher initial aggression in boys than girls. In the case of a partner moving in, the gender gap lessens with age. Among whites, having a partner move out and mothers' use of nonviolent discipline associate with higher initial aggression in boys than girls. Neither gap lessens with age.},

  Abstract                 = {I use economic theory and estimates of a semiparametrically identied structural model to analyze the role played by credit constraints, uncertainty and preferences in explaining college attendance. A methodology for inferring information available to the agent from individual choices is proposed and implemented. The test distinguishes which of the unobserved (to the analyst) components of future outcomes are known to the agent and which are unknown to both at a given stage of the life cycle. I use microdata on earnings, schooling and consumption to infer the agent's information set and estimate a model of college choice and consumption under uncertainty with equilibrium borrowing constraints. I estimate that 80\% and 44\% of the variances of college and high school earnings respectively are predictable by the agent. Moving to a no tuition economy increases college attendance from 48\% to 50\%. When people are allowed to smooth consumption, college increases to nearly 58\%. General equilibrium effects not withstanding, credit constraints have a larger effect than previously suggested.},

  Abstract                 = {{CONTEXT}: {A} program of home visitation by nurses has been shown to affect the rates of maternal welfare dependence, criminality, problems due to use of substances, and child abuse and neglect. {H}owever, the long-term effects of this program on children's antisocial behavior have not been examined. {OBJECTIVE}: {T}o examine the long-term effects of a program of prenatal and early childhood home visitation by nurses on children's antisocial behavior. {DESIGN}: {F}ifteen-year follow-up of a randomized trial. {I}nterviews were conducted with the adolescents and their biological mothers or custodial parents. {SETTING}: {S}emirural community in {N}ew {Y}ork. {PARTICIPANTS}: {B}etween {A}pril 1978 and {S}eptember 1980, 500 consecutive pregnant women with no previous live births were recruited, and 400 were enrolled. {A} total of 315 adolescent offspring participated in a follow-up study when they were 15 years old; 280 (89%) were born to white mothers, 195 (62%) to unmarried mothers, 151 (48%) to mothers younger than 19 years, and 186 (59%) to mothers from households of low socioeconomic status at the time of registration during pregnancy. {INTERVENTION}: {F}amilies in the groups that received home visits had an average of 9 (range, 0--16) home visits during pregnancy and 23 (range, 0--59) home visits from birth through the child's second birthday. {T}he control groups received standard prenatal and well-child care in a clinic. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: {C}hildren's self-reports of running away, arrests, convictions, being sentenced to youth corrections, initiation of sexual intercourse, number of sex partners, and use of illegal substances; school records of suspensions; teachers' reports of children's disruptive behavior in school; and parents' reports of the children's arrests and behavioral problems related to the children's use of alcohol and other drugs. {RESULTS}: {A}dolescents born to women who received nurse visits during pregnancy and postnatally and who were unmarried and from households of low socioeconomic status (risk factors for antisocial behavior), in contrast with those in the comparison groups, reported fewer instances (incidence) of running away (0.24 vs 0.60; {P} = .003), fewer arrests (0.20 vs 0.45; {P} = .03), fewer convictions and violations of probation (0.09 vs 0.47; {P}<.001), fewer lifetime sex partners (0.92 vs 2.48; {P}= .003), fewer cigarettes smoked per day (1.50 vs 2.50; {P}= .10), and fewer days having consumed alcohol in the last 6 months (1.09 vs 2.49; {P} = .03). {P}arents of nurse-visited children reported that their children had fewer behavioral problems related to use of alcohol and other drugs (0.15 vs 0.34; {P} = .08). {T}here were no program effects on other behavioral problems. {CONCLUSIONS}: {T}his program of prenatal and early childhood home visitation by nurses can reduce reported serious antisocial behavior and emergent use of substances on the part of adolescents born into high-risk families.},

  Abstract                 = {{OBJECTIVE}: {T}o examine the effects of prenatal and infancy home visiting by paraprofessionals and by nurses from child age 2 through age 4 years. {METHODS}: {W}e conducted, in public and private care settings in {D}enver, {C}olorado, a randomized, controlled trial with 3 arms, ie, control, paraprofessional visits, and nurse visits. {H}ome visits were provided from pregnancy through child age 2 years. {W}e invited 1178 consecutive, low-income, pregnant women with no previous live births to participate, and we randomized 735; 85% were unmarried, 47% {M}exican {A}merican, 35% white non-{M}exican {A}merican, 15% black, and 3% {A}merican {I}ndian/{A}sian. {O}utcomes consisted of maternal reports of subsequent pregnancies, participation in education and work, use of welfare, marriage, cohabitation, experience of domestic violence, mental health, substance use, and sense of mastery; observations of mother-child interaction and the home environment; tests of children's language and executive functioning; and mothers' reports of children's externalizing behavior problems. {RESULTS}: {T}wo years after the program ended, women who were visited by paraprofessionals, compared with control subjects, were less likely to be married (32.2% vs 44.0%) and to live with the biological father of the child (32.7% vs 43.1%) but worked more (15.13 months vs 13.38 months) and reported a greater sense of mastery and better mental health (standardized scores [mean = 100, {SD} = 10] of 101.25 vs 99.31 and 101.21 vs 99.16, respectively). {P}araprofessional-visited women had fewer subsequent miscarriages (6.6% vs 12.3%) and low birth weight newborns (2.8% vs 7.7%). {M}others and children who were visited by paraprofessionals, compared with control subjects, displayed greater sensitivity and responsiveness toward one another (standardized score [mean = 100, {SD} = 10] of 100.92 vs 98.66) and, in cases in which the mothers had low levels of psychologic resources at registration, had home environments that were more supportive of children's early learning (score of 24.63 vs 23.35). {N}urse-visited women reported greater intervals between the births of their first and second children (24.51 months vs 20.39 months) and less domestic violence (6.9% vs 13.6%) and enrolled their children less frequently in preschool, {H}ead {S}tart, or licensed day care than did control subjects. {N}urse-visited children whose mothers had low levels of psychologic resources at registration, compared with control group counterparts, demonstrated home environments that were more supportive of children's early learning (score of 24.61 vs 23.35), more advanced language (score of 91.39 vs 86.73), superior executive functioning (score of 100.16 vs 95.48), and better behavioral adaptation during testing (score of 100.41 vs 96.66). {T}here were no statistically significant effects of either nurse or paraprofessional visits on the number of subsequent pregnancies, women's educational achievement, use of substances, use of welfare, or children's externalizing behavior problems. {CONCLUSIONS}: {P}araprofessional-visited mothers began to experience benefits from the program 2 years after the program ended at child age 2 years, but their first-born children were not statistically distinguishable from their control group counterparts. {N}urse-visited mothers and children continued to benefit from the program 2 years after it ended. {T}he impact of the nurse-delivered program on children was concentrated on children born to mothers with low levels of psychologic resources.},

  Abstract                 = {Estimating the premorbid abilities of individuals who sustained brain injury is a vital part of neuropsychological assessments. Military providers are in a unique position in that a great many of their patients have on record a measure of ability obtained prior to onset of their medical condition. For enlisted personnel, this is the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT; U.S. Department of Defense, 1984). In this study, we examined the relation between this test and a standardized test of intelligence, the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery (Jackson, 1984). A regression equation was computed that allows estimation of intelligence from AFQT scores, providing clinicians a useful method of assessing premorbid cognitive ability in brain-injured patients.

  Abstract                 = {This book systematically and thoroughly covers the vast literature on the nonparametric and semiparametric statistics and econometrics that has evolved over the last five decades. Within this framework this is the first book to discuss the principles of the nonparametric approach to the topics covered in a first year graduate course in econometrics, e.g. regression function, heteroskedasticity, simultaneous equations models, logit-probit and censored models. Nonparametric and semiparametric methods potentially offer considerable reward to applied researchers, owing to the methods' ability to adapt to many unknown features of the data. Professors Pagan and Ullah provide intuitive explanations of difficult concepts, heuristic developments of theory, and empirical examples emphasizing the usefulness of the modern nonparametric approach. The book should provide a new perspective on teaching and research in applied subjects in general and econometrics and statistics in particular.},

  Abstract                 = {Attention has been directed toward extended school time as a measure to improve academic achievement. The school year and day length have varied over time and across localities depending on the particular needs of the community. Proponents argue that extending time will have learning and nonacademic benefits. Opponents suggest increased time is not guaranteed to lead to more effective instruction and suggest other costs. Despite noted limitations in the research, past reviewers have argued that any positive relation between allocated time and achievement is tentative and instructional quality needs to be addressed first. After a comprehensive search of the literature, 15 empirical studies of various designs conducted since 1985 were found. The literature revealed that (a) designs are generally weak for making causal inferences and (b) outcomes other than achievement are scarcely studied. That said, findings suggest that extending school time can be an effective way to support student learning, particularly (a) for students most at risk of school failure and (b) when considerations are made for how time is used. Of note, the strongest research designs produced the most consistent positive results. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {{P}resents a rigorous explanation of an equilibrium model of unemployment. {T}he current edition incorporates important new developments and discusses a variety of new results. {D}escribes a simple version of the labor-market model and illustrates the nature of unemployment in the steady state and how wages and unemployment are jointly determined. {E}xtends the model to include endogenous job destruction. {R}eturns to the model with a constant job-destruction rate; derives the condition for job creation from a conventional dynamic model of the firm with costs of adjustment; and develops a homogeneous long-run equilibrium model that is consistent with a constant unemployment rate when there is balanced economic growth. {G}eneralizes the model with endogenous job destruction to account for reasons for labor turnover other than job turnover and analyzes search on the job and job-to-job turnovers. {E}xtends the labor market model to examine the implications of search intensity and job advertising. {I}ntroduces the idea that jobs and workers have many unobservable characteristics that can influence the productivity of a job match and explores which job matches are accepted and which are rejected. {C}onsiders issues of labor-force participation and hours of work. {E}xplores whether the {N}ash wage equation internalizes search externalities leading to social efficiency. {C}onsiders whether there are optimal policy rules that remove the inefficiencies caused by the search externalities and studies the effects of linear policy rules on job creation, job destruction, the intensity of search, and the reservation rules that govern the decision of whether or not to form a match. {B}ibliography; index.},

Maturationist 2. Behaviorist 3. Cognitive-Developmental - Differences in these model made manifest in: - Teacher vs. child directiveness - Group vs. individual instruction - Teacher-giving vs. teacher-asking - Sharpest debate is use of didactive methods vs. maturationist, cognitive-developmental - Don't just need to consider curriculum at a point it time but also continuity of curriculum type - Teacher instruction varies by child sex - The dimensions of preschool classrooms that differentiate them and affect outcomes may not be the same dimensions that are affected by the curriculum used},

  Abstract                 = {Using the National Survey of Families and Households, I explore the role of cohabitation in differences between Blacks and Whites in union formation. Previous research has explained at most one-quarter of racial differences in marriage rates. Despite this and a well-documented rise in premarital cohabitation among both races, no previous research has explored racial differences in union formation. I begin by showing that the Black-White difference in the timing of first union (that is, first cohabitation or first marriage) is about one-half the Black-White difference in the timing of first marriage. Then I use proportional hazard models to determine whether racial differences in first union formation rates and first union type can be attributed to the availability of men or to men's employment characteristics. The results provide clear evidence that marriage market characteristics contribute to the lower likelihood that Black women will cohabit or will marry. However, Black-White differences in union type (that is, the greater tendency among Blacks to cohabit rather than to marry) are not related to differences in the availability of employed men.},

  Abstract                 = {The association between parental cohabitation and children's family instability is the focus of this paper. We use data from the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) to produce estimates of children's family experiences with an emphasis on the number of family transitions children experience. We also compare the experiences of children as reported by parents to those reported by children. We find that estimates of children's experience in cohabiting families is reliable and that looking at only marital status transitions greatly underestimates the amount of instability in children's lives. Adding transitions into and out of cohabitation increases our measure of family instability by about 30 percent for White children and over 100 percent for Black children.},

Study children were participants in a longitudinal study of child development in which the number of episodes of otitis media and duration of each otitis episode were reported prospectively from infancy. The incidence of otitis media was highest during the first 2 years of life. Bilateral otitis media accounted for 66% of the days with otitis media with effusion. Standardized tests of intelligence and academic performance were administered to the children when they were 3? to 6 years of age. No evidence of associations between measures of early childhood otitis media experience and these measures of verbal or academic functioning was found in this study population.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines changes in marriage as an institution for rearing children in the United States. It reviews the effects of marital instability and living arrangements on children's welfare, and focuses on how children's economic, emotional, and social needs are met when parents separate. The review shows that changes in marriage and childrearing have different consequences for women and men. For women, marriage and parenthood are distinct institutions. Women provide for children's needs, whether or not the women are married to their children's fathers. For men, marriage defines responsibilities to children. At divorce, men typically disengage from their biological children. When men remarry they may acquire new children whom they help to support. The review describes the effects on children of divorced mothers' and fathers' varying commitments to childrearing. It considers the difficulties that divorced parents experience when they try to continue to share responsibilities for children after separation, and it suggests avenues for future research.},

  Abstract                 = {Changes in the nature of work have created demands for new skills and education and training policies to enhance skill development. To successfully accomplish the latter, policymakers must first define and measure skills, then understand how they contribute to economic performance. This paper contrasts two theoretical perspectives for skills measurement: the economic perspective that dominates the policy discussion about skills, and the sociocultural perspective. The paper explores the basic assumptions about skills from each perspective and considers how each addresses different issues concerning skill requirements. It argues that the sociocultural perspective has some advantages over the dominant paradigm.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE. The goal was to examine the associations of weight-for-length at birth and at 6 months with obesity at 3 years of age.METHODS. We studied 559 children in Project Viva, an ongoing, prospective, cohort study of pregnant women and their children. We measured length and weight at birth, 6 months, and 3 years. Our main exposures were weight-for-length z score at birth adjusted for gestational age and weight-for-length z score at 6 months adjusted for weight-for-length z score at birth. We used multivariate regression analyses to predict the independent effects of birth weight-for-length z score and, separately, 6-month weight-for-length z score on BMI z score, the sum of subscapular and triceps skinfold thicknesses, and obesity (BMI for age and gender of =95th percentile) at age 3.RESULTS. Mean weights at birth, 6 months, and 3 years were 3.55, 8.15, and 15.67 kg, respectively. Corresponding lengths were 49.9, 66.9, and 97.4 cm. At 3 years, 48 children (9%) were obese. After adjustment for confounding variables and birth weight-for-length z score, each increment in 6-month weight-for-length z score was associated with higher BMI z scores, higher sums of subscapular and triceps skinfold thicknesses, and increased odds of obesity at age 3. The predicted obesity prevalence among children in the highest quartiles of both birth and 6-month weight-for-length z scores was 40%, compared with 1% for children in the lowest quartiles of both. Whereas birth weight-for-length z scores were associated with higher BMI z scores, the magnitude of effect was smaller than that of weight-for-length z scores at 6 months.CONCLUSIONS. More-rapid increases in weight for length in the first 6 months of life were associated with sharply increased risk of obesity at 3 years of age. Changes in weight status in infancy may influence risk of later obesity more than weight status at birth.},

  Abstract                 = {This study examined the relationship between adolescent emotional adjustment and the family environment (i.e., family status, family process, and parental resources). This was done by way of multilevel analyses, with a sample of 2,636 parent-child couples of both intact and divorced families. The results indicated that adolescent emotional adjustment was clearly based on the family as well as on the individual. We found support for the hypothesis that growing up both in postdivorce families and in intact families with a low marital quality related negatively to adolescent emotional adjustment. Our hypothesis that parental resources, in the form of parental support, parent-adolescent relationship, and parental psychological health, partly mediate the negative association between low marital quality and divorce on one hand and youngsters' adjustment on the other hand was also confirmed. Growing up in postdivorce families was especially detrimental for the emotional adjustment of girls.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Anxiety disorders are common psychiatric conditions affecting children and adolescents. Although cognitive behavioral therapy and selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors have shown efficacy in treating these disorders, little is known about their relative or combined efficacy. Methods In this randomized, controlled trial, we assigned 488 children between the ages of 7 and 17 years who had a primary diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or social phobia to receive 14 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, sertraline (at a dose of up to 200 mg per day), a combination of sertraline and cognitive behavioral therapy, or a placebo drug for 12 weeks in a 2:2:2:1 ratio. We administered categorical and dimensional ratings of anxiety severity and impairment at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Results The percentages of children who were rated as very much or much improved on the Clinician Global Impression-Improvement scale were 80.7% for combination therapy (P<0.001), 59.7% for cognitive behavioral therapy (P<0.001), and 54.9% for sertraline (P<0.001); all therapies were superior to placebo (23.7%). Combination therapy was superior to both monotherapies (P<0.001). Results on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale documented a similar magnitude and pattern of response; combination therapy had a greater response than cognitive behavioral therapy, which was equivalent to sertraline, and all therapies were superior to placebo. Adverse events, including suicidal and homicidal ideation, were no more frequent in the sertraline group than in the placebo group. No child attempted suicide. There was less insomnia, fatigue, sedation, and restlessness associated with cognitive behavioral therapy than with sertraline. Conclusions Both cognitive behavioral therapy and sertraline reduced the severity of anxiety in children with anxiety disorders; a combination of the two therapies had a superior response rate.

  Abstract                 = {Background?The objective of this study was to examine the association of Joint National Committee (JNC-V) blood pressure and National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) cholesterol categories with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, to incorporate them into coronary prediction algorithms, and to compare the discrimination properties of this approach with other noncategorical prediction functions.Methods and Results?This work was designed as a prospective, single-center study in the setting of a community-based cohort. The patients were 2489 men and 2856 women 30 to 74 years old at baseline with 12 years of follow-up. During the 12 years of follow-up, a total of 383 men and 227 women developed CHD, which was significantly associated with categories of blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (all P<.001). Sex-specific prediction equations were formulated to predict CHD risk according to age, diabetes, smoking, JNC-V blood pressure categories, and NCEP total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol categories. The accuracy of this categorical approach was found to be comparable to CHD prediction when the continuous variables themselves were used. After adjustment for other factors, ?28% of CHD events in men and 29% in women were attributable to blood pressure levels that exceeded high normal (?130/85). The corresponding multivariable-adjusted attributable risk percent associated with elevated total cholesterol (?200 mg/dL) was 27% in men and 34% in women.Conclusions?Recommended guidelines of blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol effectively predict CHD risk in a middle-aged white population sample. A simple coronary disease prediction algorithm was developed using categorical variables, which allows physicians to predict multivariate CHD risk in patients without overt CHD.},
