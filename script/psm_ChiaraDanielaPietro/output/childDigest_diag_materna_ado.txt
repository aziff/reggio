Mean = average of the y-variable for the whole sample considered. Sample: Reggio = only respondents in the city of Reggio Emilia. RAvsPrPd = Reggio Approach and all the respondents in Parma and Padova. RePr= all of the respondents in Reggio Emilia and Parma. RePd= all of the respondents in Reggio Emilia and Padova. Estimation Procedure: OLS = Ordinary Least Square; IV = Instrumental variable approach; CF = control function approach										
cubic polynomial or residuals. PSM = simple propensity score matching. PSM2 = propensity sore matching using both demand and supply. DiD = differences-in-differences approach
